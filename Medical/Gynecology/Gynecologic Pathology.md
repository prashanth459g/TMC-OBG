### Arias-Stella reaction
- [#link/Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=Arias-Stella+reaction+uterus), [#link/Wiley](https://obgyn.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1471-0528.1962.tb01332.x) [Pathology outline](https://www.pathologyoutlines.com/topic/uterusariasstella.html)
- Definition
	-  Distinctive (usually focal) benign nuclear enlargement of "exaggerated hyperplastic" appearance characterized by centronuclear vacuolization, typically associated with pregnancy or hormone effect
	-  Typically found in the endometria of post abortion curettings (20% - 70%) of intra or extrauterine pregnancies, moles and choriocarcinoma; also in adenomyosis and adenomyomatous polyps of the uterus or endocervix; in endocervical polyps, epithelia of fallopian tube, foci of endometriosis, paraovarian and paratubal cysts, vaginal adenosis
	-   There is no mass
	-   This finding may provide *initial histologic "clue" of ectopic* pregnancy [ ](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17219163)
- Essential features
	-  Pseudoneoplastic glandular response of the female genital tract, first described by Javier Arias-Stella in 1954 as atypical endometrial changes associated with the presence of chorionic tissue
	-  Characterized by enlarged glands with abundant clear or eosinophilic cytoplasm and vacuolization associated with hyperchromatic, pleomorphic and smudged nuclei - *"hobnail" appearance* [[Gynecologic Pathology#^80887a]]
	-  Frequently occurs as a reaction in the endometrium of women of reproductive age with intrauterine / extrauterine pregnancy and gestational trophoblastic disease
	-  The finding of Arias-Stella effect in secretory endometrium is not diagnostic of intrauterine (even extrauterine) pregnancy
		-  Rarely can be seen in nonpregnant patients on hormonal therapy (oral contraceptives, ovulation inducing drugs and hormone replacement therapies and phytoestrogens) and more rarely in patients without hormonal treatment
		-  Described also in extraendometrial sites: endocervix, fallopian tube, endometriosis (cervix, ovarian, peritoneal, subcutaneous, umbilica, urinary bladder), paraovarian and paratubal cysts, vaginal adenosis, ovarian germinal inclusion cysts, luteal cysts of puerperium and gestation and even in some ovarian mucinous neoplasms
	-  Usually easy to recognize because it predominantly affects young and pregnant patients; however, it may occasionally raise concern for carcinoma if detected in nonpregnant or older patients
	-  No need for treatment since it is a benign condition that usually regresses post partum
-   **Synonyms**: Arias-Stella phenomenon / Arias-Stella change / Arias-Stella effect
- Epidemiology	
	-   Relatively common phenomenon
	    -   May be seen in up to 50% of gravid hysterectomies
	    -   Arias-Stella changes in endometrial glands are observed in 80% cases of intrauterine abortions
	    -   In endocervix of pregnant women, occurrence is 9% - 37.5% 
	    -   Can occur as early as 17 days post conception
	-   Most commonly occurs in reproductive aged women and in the background of pregnancy; however it may be seen in women of all ages and in any type of hormonal alteration (exogenous and endogenous)
- Pathophysiology
	-   Represents a "==cellular transdifferentiation==" process: conversion of a *differentiated* cell type into another cell type 
	-   *Hormone related atypical endometrial reaction, related to the effects of estrogens and progesterone acting simultaneously* 
	-   Associated with:
	    -   Pregnancy 
	    -   Gestational trophoblastic disease
	    -   Oral contraceptives and ovulation inducing drugs 
	    -   Postmenopausal women taking hormone replacement therapies 
	    -   Phytoestrogen use 
	-   Very rarely, ASR can occur in the absence of pregnancy or hormonal intake, also in foci of endometriosis 
- Clinical features --> Incidental finding
- Diagnosis
	-   Microscopic finding
	-   Arias-Stella glandular changes can be present also in cytological material obtained from cervix and vagina trough Pap test during pregnancy and post partum
- Laboratory
	-   Increased serum levels of beta human chorionic gonadotropin (Î²-hCG) if associated with pregnancy
- Radiology description
	-   Ultrasonography can reveal a pregnancy (intra- or extrauterine)
- Prognostic factors
	-   Excellent prognosis (benign condition)
- Gross description
	-   Does not typically form mass lesion
	-   May extensively involve preexisting polyp
- Microscopic (histologic) description
	-   Intraglandular papillary epithelial tufts
	-   Some cases shows hobnail growth pattern, with nuclei placed at the bulbous shaped apical portion of the cytoplasm
	-   Vacuoles are formed within these tufts and there is a loss of cellular polarity
	-   Dr. Arias-Stella classified the histologic variants into five types:
	    -   _Minimal atypia_: characterized by mild nuclear enlargement
	    -   _Early secretory pattern_: marked nuclear enlargement, subnuclear and supranuclear vacuoles
	    -   _Secretory or hypersecretory pattern_: enlarged nuclei and intense and diffuse cytoplasmic vacuolization
	    -   _Regenerative, proliferative or nonsecretory pattern_: nuclei with a vesicular configuration with glands showing no / minimal secretory activity
	    -   _Monstrous cell pattern_: nuclei show giant and bizarre forms with homogenous chromatin and frequent pseudoinclusions
	- Cytology description
		-   Cellular enlargement, mainly of the nucleus, to double or many times normal size
		-   Hypertrophied nuclei of ovoid or round shape with granular or vesicular viable chromatin, an irregular outline and hyperchromatic appearance or a compact, pyknotic pattern
		-   Some cases can have optically clear nuclei or nuclear pseudoinclusions
		-   Abundant cytoplasm may be densely eosinophilic or clear and vacuolated
		-   Normal nuclear to cytoplasmic ratio
		-   Mitotic figures in 10% to 15% of cases; rarely can be atypical or numerous 
	- Electron microscopy description
		-   Overall few organelles; sparse particles that resemble granules of ribonucleic acid in the clear cells
		-   However, conspicuous Golgi apparatus, vesicles of endoplasmic reticulum, numerous mitochondrial crests, and Palade grains in the dark cells
	- Molecular / cytogenetics description
		-   Nuclei of ASR cells enlarge because of DNA polyploid contents; aneuploidy is absent ([Adv Anat Pathol 2002;9:12](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11756756))
