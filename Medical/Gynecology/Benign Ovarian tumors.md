# Benign Ovarian tumors

### 





### Classification of benign ovarian tumors
you can classify them into non new classic tumors and neoclassic tumors 
under the non neoclassic tumors.
Patients who want to vessel go and gynecological and you will be also able to formulate a plan for management of the tumors according to the age of the patient and the peculiarity. So coming to the classification of vinyl ovarian tumors, you can classify them into non neoclastic tumors and neoclassific tumors under the non neoclastic tumors. We have journal intrusions and follicles. corpus luteum cysts, pregnancy, luteum or tical ludensis, scratchy coarse. Otherwise what we call nowadays as false recovery and endometrioma. These non the neoprenic tumors are derived from the ceramic epithelium. They are cystic tumors like serial sisterinova nucinous hystericoma underneath that form. And she was a thromal overgrowth or fibroma arena, fibroma unprinted inverse and tumors derived from germ cells or turmoil. Otherwise known as benign cystic teratoma. So first we will say about the non neoplastic benign covariant worst which will be the germinal inclusion cyst. Other Carticle inclusions. You should take an occur at any age, but mostly they are common during the post manifolds of each group. How do they form the better genesis is to the imagination of the ovarian surface epithelium, or implantation of the tubal epithelium, then the ovarian surface epithelium is disrupted at ovation. So how do they appear on the gross picture? They can appear as small as bulging at the ovarian surface and under. microscopic picture, they can be either peritoneal inclusions or olarian inclusions. Peritorial inclusions will be lined by simple flat epithelium, devoid of cilia or nozzle. Valerian incursions will be lying by simple cuboidal to columns. Sometimes admits with non selenated or secretary of pixels. They can also have some of our bodies in the adjacent stomach coming to immunohistous chemistry in the Mullerian Taxis. You will have pack a BREP 4 and WT1 positive wildcard written in D 240 will be negative But in the per tonal intuitions, your tile between an and D 240 will be positive, while your path sake and BREP 4 will be negative. But WT1 will be positive also in the peritorium intrusions. So coming to the folic lessons, they are mostly dependent on the token spark group. How do they form either because of non rupture of a dominant pole or the. small follicles which has not grown up so they are found as early as 40 weeks of gestation in the female heaters and they usually found in women who are men having the mid suicide in women with such fibrosis. They appear to have an increased propensity for developing individual polygluses. These large solitary follicuses aligning or lutein They are usually occasionally discovered during pregnancy and the pupilium. The California 125 will be in the normal range as it is a virane ovarian system. What are the complications associated with the polypresses? It can be ruptured which will present in the patient as a tennis nurse or transient pelvic tininess or the visperomia and sometimes no pain also in patients who have chronically anticoagulated or those with one willy brand disease they can have significant intraperitoneal bleeding associated with structure. These forecloses are associated with elevated blood leads to grain level so we. can also present with abnormal neutron bleeding either a regular cycle with prolonged incremental interval or followed by the source of minor region coming to the pathology. Usually they will appear as multiple cysts vary from 2.5 to three centimeter as larger 15 centimeter in garner in the gross they are translucent thin bolt and they are filled with watering and clear to stock fluid in a microscopy. Usually they are situated in no variant cortex and the lining of the cyst is usually composed of a closely packed layer of brown plum granulos assists. But simple spatial cells of the tikka internal deeper in the stomach. So how can we manage these polypuses? Usually they disappear spontaneously. So what we have to do is just wait and watch. So we wait and watch for 4 to 8 weeks. Either they disappear by reabsorption of the silent fluid or because of silent structure. If there are complexes or persistent simple cells larger than 10 centimeters, then it should be evaluated. So coming to the next benign symbols which is will be your corpus routine cells on a gross it will be have a smooth surface and it will be published straight to browning color under cut section. It will have a convulated lining will be in Juish orange and the center will have a blitz crop. What were the symptoms and fines of the copper? Usually it can have the patient can represent with normal endocrine function, or they can have prolonged situation of so I might as well pattern may be normal. Delay administration or amenorrhea. But a classic symptom which is associated with the corpus victims is a halban stroke, which will be a normal. followed by sporting ideal natural pelvic pain and a small tinder alignation mass. They can be associated with catastrophic and massive interperatinal bearing between day 20 to day 26 associated with rupture following coitus exercise, droma or pelvic examination. These capture usually happens frequently in patients who are on anticoagulants or with leading diagraphs. So the differential diagnosis for our corpus luteum, because it presents with intraperitoneal bleeding or ectopic pregnancy, erupted endometrioma or an adlexa torsion. So how. can we differentiate it from the other differential diagnosis? We do either a urine pregnancy test or serum beta ICG, which will be negative in corpus 2THUMBS and cultural synthesis. If the hematocrit of the fluid uptime from the posterior kalisa is more than 15% then effective operative therapy is decremented. If it is less, even though that is a rupture on free food in the peritorium, we can still go and with observation. and for unruptured copper suitums observation is a treatment of choice. Now moving on to pregnancy luteumos, they are hyperplasia of the luteinized romal cells. Secondary to stimulation by beta hcg. Take coexist with polycystic covariant syndrome and dabitus in pregnancy lutermous because there is a luteinized romocytes. So there is increased testocerone levels which may be elevated up to 70 times normal but only 25% of the women experienced viralization. Why so? Because in pregnancy we all know there is increased level of sex or more binding globin which binds with this test zero. So only 25% of the movement will experience the symptoms of increase or hyperantrogen levels. Out of which these 25% women, only 60 to 70% of the female windfance will be paralyzed. So the management of the pregnancy ludium mass depends upon the clinical presentation. The characteristic of the mass is stational age and the patient preference. Usually we will observe through the pregnancy. Very rarely will go for surgical management So coming to the pathology of dependency loom or in the gross, they appear as circumcised by multinodal solid forces in a microscopy. They show sheets of large, round polygon uses with abundant hemophiliac cyclogasm and glitten or no lipid. So that is how we differentiate our pregnancy luteum mass from steroids and tumors. Then. moving on to the colludences, they are usually bilateral and they produce massive to enlargement of the ovaries. They arrive from either prolonged or excessive stimulation of the overings by endogenous or exogenous garner tokens, or anything ovarian sensitivity tokens. So they are usually associated with molar patterncies and choreocarcinomons. They are also found in conditions where there is large presenters such as winds, diarrhetis or a sensitization, and we may not covolation induction in our. in associated with normal tendency as well as a newborn influence. Secondly, to transparent element of methanol bono programs, rarely these sisters are found in end girls with juvenile hypotyriadism. So how do we manage these equilibriums? Usually they disappear once the source has been removed, like when the goral trophy levels revert back to normal, the takeaway utensils usually disappear coming. to the ovarian endometrioma, the petogenesis impagination and subsequent collection of the menstrual differs from endometriotic influence which are located on the ovarian surface and other in territorial. This was the first theory which talked about how the ovarian endometriums are formed. Next it was modified as either due to colonization of the functional ovariances by endometriosis or cenomic metaphysia of the invalidated epithelial inclusions. These three theories are mainly basis for the for ovarian elementary coming. to the technology they will have a fibroidic walls, a smooth lining which contain dark brown content. That is why we call it as chocolates and these as well usually will be adherent to the adjacent contents and in microscopy at least two of the three following feature should be done. The enamel type glance and also evidence of chronic hemorrhage. That is famous laden or whom in macrophages should be there. So what will be the symptoms we all know it is usually this manoria, this peronia, this gesia non cyclical pelvic Important. So how do we manage these ovarian intermittent models? Previously, we thought it depends upon the size of the ovarian intervention. Now we have moved forward from the ideology. So we train the patient over an endometriosis based on the symptoms. If it is going to be for pain, you should be treated with medical management. It will be either Protestants or ease written suppression with any other drugs. So or we can use go for surgery or a combination of both medical and surgical therapy. So what are the options available in the surgical management of fundamentally amount? You have suspect followed by ablation by laser or by plasma energy or electro coagulation. So the cystectomy, the walls may be difficult to feel off from the cyst. But what we can do is we can just cut open this, drain the fluid fill up as much as possible, or inject the bath so pleasant between this is fall under ovarian surface, so that it will be easier to remove the system. Or we can give the patient jnr analog for three cycles and then go back and again redo the surgery where you will be able to peel off the photon complete system. So coming to zero, cystic over or these overs, it is another benign condition, but it is a topic of its own. So I am not going into detail about the Pcos. Just keep it in mind that peso is also a considered as a binite ovarian chug. Now moving on to neoplastic mini ovarian tubers. The most common is syrasysteroinoma. And how does it look? The gross it will have in a locker layer. The surface will be smooth. And the sense fluid is will be usually thin, watery and yellow tension. It may or may not have substitutions. And you can see papillary projections, large or small, on the surface of the. coming to the microscopic picture. The epithelium will be of low columnar type with cilia. And you can even find some of our body which are the end product of degeneration of the papillary influence. So associated fibroids, then you may call this conditional cyst study of fibromox. So what would be the symptoms? Usually it will be incidental finding only because the patient will be asymptomatic. Depending upon the size of the mass, the patient can present with pain or symptoms due to pressure on the bladder or **** or because of rupture or torsion of the cyst. So the ultrasound appearance would be similar to the large functional cys. It will be like unilateral and sample. Now moving on to wheels in a sister diroma in the gross, the muscles will be round or over with smooth capsules that are usually transpose and bluish to white 3.
