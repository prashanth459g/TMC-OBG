#### LOW-MALIGNANT-POTENTIAL TUMORS
- 10 to 15 percent of epithelial ovarian cancers have histologic and biologic features that are intermediate between clearly benign cysts and frankly invasive carcinomas. In general, these low-malignant-potential (LMP) tumors, also termed borderline tumors, are associated with risk factors that are similar to those for epithelial ovarian cancer. 
- Typically, they are not considered part of any of the hereditary breast-ovarian cancer syndromes. 
- Although LMP tumors may devlop at any age, on average, patients are in their mid-40s, which is 15 years younger than women with invasive ovarian carcinoma. For various reasons, their diagnosis and optimal management are frequently problematic.
- Histologically, LMP tumors are distinguished from benign cysts by having at least two of the following features: nuclear atypia, epithelial stratification, microscopic papillary projections, cellular pleomorphism, or mitotic activity. Unlike invasive carcinomas, LMP tumors lack stromal invasion.

- Clinical Features
	- Ovarian LMP tumors present similar to other adnexal masses.
	- Preoperatively, no sonographic findings are pathognomonic, and serum CA125 levels are nonspecific. 
	- Depending on the clinical setting, computed tomography (CT) scanning may be indicated to exclude ascites or omental caking. which would suggest a more typical ovarian cancer. Regardless, any woman with a suspicious adnexal mass should have it removed.
- Treatment
	- LMP tumors are primarily managed surgically. The operative plan will vary, depending on circumstance, and patients are carefully counseled beforehand. All women should be prepared for complete ovarian cancer surgical staging or debulking, if needed
	- In many cases, a laparoscopic approach is appropriate.
	- If laparotomy is planned, a vertical incision is selected to allow access to the upper abdomen and paraaortic nodes, if needed, for cancer staging.
	- Owing surgery, peritoneal washings are immediately collected upon entrance into the abdomen, which is then carefully explored. The ovarian mass is removed intact and submitted for pathologic consultation and frozen section evaluation.
	- However, differentiating a benign adnexal mass, LMP tumor, or invasive ovarian cancer is almost impossible until final histology slides have been reviewed. 
	- Accordingly, pre-menopausal women who have not completed childbearing and women's who are intraoperatively diagnosed with an LMP tumor may undergo fertility sparing surgery. This approach preserves the uterus and contralateral ovary. This is a reasonable approach even if the final diagnosis shows invasive stage I cancer. 
	- Alternatively, postmenopausal women should undergo hysterectomy and BSO.
	- Biopsies of the peritoneum and omentum as a part of limited ovarian cancer staging are considered
- LMP tumors are staged with the same FIGO criteria used for invasive ovarian cancer



- Prognosis
	- The prognosis is excellent for patients with ovarian LMP tumors. Five-year survival rates range from 96 to 99 percent for stages I-III, whereas it reaches 77 percent for stage IV disease




### EPITHELIAL OVARIAN CANCER
##### Types
- Pathogenesis
	- There are two types of epithelial ovarian cancers. This is mainly based on tumorogenic pathways.
- first tumor group develops 
	- either from the benign extra ovarian lesions that implants an ovary and subsequently undergo malignant transformation. 
	- Or from a portion of the ovary and surface epithelium that becomes *entrapped* within the cortex. this trapped cortical inclusion cyst *undergo m√ºllerian metaplasia* and is exposed to hormones and inflammatory stimuli that induce DNA damage and mutation. 
	- Clinically
		- presents as large unilateral cystic neoplasms without ascitis.
		- diagnosed early. accounts for only 10% of ovarian cancer deaths.
	- This group is further divided into 
		- endometriosis associated tumors. 
		- Low grade serous carcinomas. 
		- Mucinous carcinomas.
		- malignant brenner tumors.
- The second, more common group invariably contains high grade serious carcinomas arising from fallopian tube fimbria. 
	- Although the neoplastic transformational trigger of fallopian tube cells is unclear, Serous tubal intra epithelial carcinoma **(STIC)** is a precursor condition.
- Half of these tumors are characterized by mutation in the gene involved in the HR pathway of DNA repair, especially BRCA 1 and BRCA 2.

##### Clinical Evaluation
- Clinical features.
	- presents with increased  abdominal size in bloating, urinary urgency and pelvic pain.
	- fatigue, indigestion, inability to eat normally. Constipation and back pain also may be noted.
	- AUB is rare.
	- If carcinomatosis is particularly widespread 
		- Occasionally presents with nausea and vomiting and a partial bowel obstruction.
	- Mass is palpable in most patient with Ovarian cancers during bimanual air valuation.
		- malignant tumors tends to be solid, nodular and fixed.
		- paradoxically, a huge mass filling the pelvis and abdomen more often represents benign or borderline tumor.
	- always do rectovaginal examination to know the involvement of rectovaginal septum.
	- Ascites is may be noted. 
		- Woman with a pelvic mass + ascites it is the diagnosis is ovarian cancer until proven otherwise.
		- however, ascites without a mass, you should think of Cirrhosis or primary malignance from stomach or pancreas.
	- In advance cases. examination of upper abdomen usually reveals a central mass signifying *omental caking*
	- Sister Mary Joseph sign - although rare an umbilical nodule reflects spread from inter abdominal malignancy.
	- Don't forget to auscultate chest for plural effusion and palpate peripheral lymph nodes in addition to general physical assessment. 
- Investigations.
	- CBC. you can see thrombocytosis. 
		- which is usually due to malignant ovarian cells releasing cytokines. which increases the platelet production rate.
	- hyponatremia. 
		- Typically between 125 to 130 milli equivalent per liter. which is usually due to tumor secretion of Vasopressin like substance. which can mimic SIADH.
	- CA125 Very integral to epithelial ovarian Cancer Management.
	- HE 4. used in Roma score.
	- RMI 4.
	- CA19-9 & CEA markers may be used in Mucinous ovarian tumors.
- Imaging.
	- Transvaginal sonography is typically the most useful imaging test. Several presumptive emerging models have been described.
		- in advanced diseases, sonography has limited use
	- Chest x-ray. To roll out pulmonary effusion and metastasis.
	- CT scanning.
		- primary roll in treatment planning for women with advanced ovarian cancers. Done pre operatively to know the exchange of spread there. by to guide a surgical cider reduction or to detect obvious unresectable diseases.
		- Ct scanning accuracy is poor for differentiating a benign ovarian mask from a malignant tumor. When disease is limited to pelvic. In these cases, transvaginal sonography is superior.
	- MRI and PET generally provide limited additional information.
- paracentesis. Is there a role?
	- As I said previously, pelvic mass with ascites usually can. be assumed to have a ovarian cancer until surgically proven otherwise. But diagnostic paracentesis is often yields non specific report and it can cause abdominal wall metastasis at the needle entry site. So it is generally avoided.
	- It may be indicated for those with ascites in the absence of pelvic mass.
	- However, This may relieve volume related symptoms in those with large accumulations.

- So what do you do as a obstetrician?
	- Ascetic or evidence of metastasis should prompt consideration of consultation with an oncologist.
	- as a gynecologist. you start working up the patient do. CA125 & Other scorings
	- Ideally for a patient with suspicious adnexal mass. 
		- Surgery is performed in a hospital with pathologist able to reliably interpret and interoperative frozen section.
		- Peritoneal psychology are obtained.
		- Mass removed intact through an incision that permits thorough staging and resection of possible metastatic sites.
		- If malignancy is diagnosed Surgical staging is completed.
		- Surgeon should be prepared to appropriately stage and potentially debulk over in cancers or have a gynec oncologist immediately available. 
		- This type of careful planning achieves the best surgical results and improves survival rates.
	- for women with malignancy identified only post operatively or intraoperatively and without adequate staging. Management will vary.
		- early stage disease. Restage will laparoscopically or robotically.
		- Advanced diseases. Second laparotomy to achieve optimal tumor Debulking.
		- Extensive disease. if found at initial surgery Chemotherapy may be selected first and followed later by interval cytoreduction.
	- Post operative surveillance. in early stage diseases depending on the diagnosis. Monitoring for relapse. in advanced diseases. may be needed.
