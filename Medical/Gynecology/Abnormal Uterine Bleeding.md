# Abnormal Uterine Bleeding
### Definitions 
Abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB) may display several patterns, and descriptive terms have been updated to standardize nomenclature
- heavy menstrual bleeding (**HMB**) ( formerly menorrhagia) defines prolonged or heavy cyclic menstruation. 
	- Objectively, menses lasting longer than 7 days or exceeding 80 mL of blood loss are determining values. 
- The term **intermenstrual bleeding** replaces metrorrhagia. 
	- The term *breakthrough bleeding* is a more informal term or intermenstrual bleeding that accompanies hormone administration. 
	- The term *withdrawal bleeding* refers to the predictable bleeding that results from an abrupt decline in progesterone levels. 
- In some women, there is diminished flow or shortening of menses, **hypomenorrhea**. 
- Women normally menstruate every 28 days ± 7 days. Cycles with intervals longer than 35 days describe a state of **oligomenorrhea**. 
- Finally, **postcoital bleeding** is that prompted by vaginal intercourse.
### Theory 
- The International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) *systems for nomenclature of symptoms of normal and abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB) in the reproductive years* (FIGO AUB System 1) and for **classification of causes of AUB** (FIGO AUB System 2; PALM-COEIN) were first published together in 2011.
- 
- *PALM COIEN* (pronounced “pahm-koin") - FIGO AUB system 2
	- The basic system comprises 4 categories that are defined by visually objective structural criteria (PALM), 4 that are unrelated to structural anomalies (COEI), and 1 reserved for entities that are not yet classified (N). 
		- The leiomyoma category (L) is subdivided into patients with at least 1 submucosal myoma (LSM) and those with myomas that do not impact the endometrial cavity (LO).

	- **Polyp**
		- There seems to be little controversy regarding the inclusion of endometrial and endocervical polyps. 
		- These epithelial proliferations comprise a variable vascular, glandular, and fibromuscular and connective tissue component and are often asymptomatic, but it is generally accepted that at least some contribute to the genesis of AUB
	- **Adenomyosis**
		- The relationship between adenomyosis and the genesis of AUB is unclear.
		- The sonographic appearance of adenomyosis is 
			- partly related to the absolute presence of heterotopic endometrial tissue in the myometrium and 
			- partly due to the related myometrial hypertrophy.
		- *Adenomyosis diagnostic criteria* by TVS --> ≥2 is diagnostic
			- Graphical depictions of the eight TVUS criteria proposed by the MUSA(Morphological Uterus Sonographic Assessment) group are presented.
				- ![[Pasted image 20220713032451.png]]
			- These include asymmetrical myometrial thickening (A); myometrial cysts (B); hyperechoic islands (C); fan shaped shadowing (D); echogenic subendometrial lines and buds (E); translesional vascularity (F), where present; irregular junctional zone (G); and an interrupted junctional zone (H). 
			- Identification and evaluation of the junctional zone may best be accomplished with three-dimensional ultrasonography. 
			- For the present at least, the presence of two or more of these criteria are highly associated with a diagnosis of adenomyosis. 
	- **Leiomyoma**
		- ![[Pasted image 20220711034017.png]]
		- Now Type 3 also comes under submucous leiomyoma
		- Type 0 & 7 *vs* 1 & 6
			- now accomplished by comparing the stalk diameter to the mean diameter of the leiomyoma. 
			- Types 0 and 7 now comprise leiomyomas that have a ==stalk diameter== that is 10% or less than the mean diameter of the leiomyoma.
		- Type 2 *vs* 3
			- ==Hysteroscopy== has now been deemed the standard for distinguishing between a Type 2 and 3 leiomyoma, with the determination based upon the lowest filling pressure that allows visualization of the endometrial cavity. 
		- Type 4 *vs* 5
			- Distinguishing between Type 4 and Type 5 leiomyomas should be based upon observation of ==distortion of the serosa== (Type 5) as determined by ultrasonography or MRI
	- **Malignancy and hyperplasia**
		- endometrial hyperplasia, premalignant hyperplastic or malignant process is identified during investigation of women of reproductive age with AUB, it would be classified as AUB-M and then subclassified using the appropriate WHO or FIGO system.
	- **Coagulopathy**
	- **Ovulatory disorders**
	- **Iatrogenic**
		- AUB associated with the use of selected categories of systemic pharmacotherapy or intrauterine systems or devices, is classified as “iatrogenic”.
		- In addition to gonadal steroids such as estrogens, progestins, and androgens, and agents that directly affect their production or local function, this category now includes nonsteroidal pharmaceuticals that contribute to ovulatory disorders, such as those that affect dopamine metabolism, including phenothiazines and tricyclic antidepressants. 
		- In the original categorization, women with AUB associated with the use of *anticoagulants* were categorized with coagulopathies (AUB-C); in this revision, they are considered iatrogenic and classified as AUB-I.
			- This includes the modern, non-vitamin-K antagonists such as rivaroxaban that appears to have a greater impact on the volume of menstrual bleeding than the traditional, vitamin K antagonists, typified by warfarin

	- Regularity --> ±4 days
		- definition of regularity has been changed from one where the shortest to longest variation is up to 20 days, to variation of 7–9 days, depending upon age (18–25 years ≤9 days; 26–41 years ≤7 days; 42–45 years ≤9 days). 
		- For practical purposes, this normal variation in cycle length can be alternatively expressed as **±4 days**
	- **HMB**, a symptom (not a diagnosis), that has been defined as “excessive menstrual blood loss, which interferes with a woman’s physical, social, emotional and/or material quality of life”
- ACUTE VERSUS CHRONIC NONGESTATIONAL AUB IN THE REPRODUCTIVE YEARS
	- Chronic nongestational AUB in the reproductive years is defined as bleeding from the uterine corpus that is abnormal in duration, volume, frequency, and/or regularity, and has been present for the majority of the preceding 6 months. 
	- Acute AUB, on the other hand, is defined as an episode of heavy bleeding that, in the opinion of the clinician, is of sufficient quantity to require immediate intervention to minimize or prevent further blood loss. 
		- Acute heavy menstrual bleeding may present in the context of existing chronic AUB or can occur in the absence of such a background history.

### Bedside
Assessing HMB in a clinical setting has its limitations. First, patient perception of blood loss and objective measurement often fail to correlate 
As a result, objective methods to assess blood loss have been investigated.

	- With a scoring sheet, patients are asked to record daily the number of sanitary products that are lightly, moderately, or completely saturated. 
	- Scores are assigned as follows: 
		- 1 point or each lightly stained tampon, 5 if moderately saturated, and 10 if completely soaked. 
		- Pads are similarly given ascending scores of 1, 5, and 20, respectively. 
		- Small clots score 1 point, whereas large clots score 5. 
	- Points are then tallied or each day. totals more than 100 points per menstrual cycle correlate with greater than 80 mL objective blood loss
- Menstrual calendars are also frequently used to evaluate abnormal bleeding and its patterns. 
	- With this, patients are asked to record dates and blood flow quality throughout the month.

	- These calendars can be used to aid diagnosis and to document improvement during medical treatment.
