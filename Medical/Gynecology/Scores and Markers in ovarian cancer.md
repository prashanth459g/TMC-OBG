# RMI 4
RMI I combines 4 pre-surgical features: serum CA125 (CA125), Size (S) menopausal status (M) and ultrasound score (U). 

**RMI = U x M x CA125 x S** 

-   The ultrasound result is scored 1 point for each of the following characteristics: *multilocular cysts, solid areas, bilateral lesions, metastases and ascites* 
	- U = 1 (for an ultrasound score of 0 to 1), 
	- U = 4 (for an ultrasound score of ≥2)    
-   The menopausal status is scored as 1 = pre-menopausal and 4 = post-menopausal.
	-   The classification of 'post-menopausal' is a woman who has had no period for more than 1 year or a woman over 50 who has had a hysterectomy.
-   Serum CA125 is measured in IU/ml and can vary between 0 and hundreds or even thousands of units.
- Size
	- A tumor size (single greatest diameter) of <7 cm made S=1, and ≥7 cm made S=2.

Interpretation:[^2] 

|**RMI**|**Risk of malignancy**|
|----|----|
|≤450|Low|
|\>450|High|

\*With cutoff level of 450 the sensitivity, **specificity**, positive predictive value, *negative predictive value* and accuracy were respectively, 86.8%, **91.0%**, 63.5%, *97.5%*, and 90.4% for ovarian cancer.

# ROMA 
- Risk of Ovarian Malignancy Algorithm (ROMA) utilising human epididymis secretory protein 4 (HE4) and CA125 classified patients as --> presenting as high or low risk for *epithelial* ovarian cancer (EOC).

# ROCA
- The ROCA Test is a simple blood test that detects the likelihood of a woman having ovarian cancer. The ROCA Test uses a woman's age, menopausal status, risk status and serial blood measurements of **CA-125** to produce a score that indicates her chances of having ovarian cancer.

# HE4
- human epididymis secretory protein 4

- [zzz](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3048204/)
- Serum CA125 assay has low sensitivity in the early stages and can be increased in certain conditions such as menstruation or endometriosis. 
- The level of HE4 is overexpressed in ovarian tumors. 
- Its specificity is 94% and its level is not affected by endometriosis cysts.

# OVA1 --> Overa
- This assay, now known as OVA1, incorporates serum levels of five serum proteins (transthyretin, apolipoprotein A-1, b2-microglobulin, transferrin, and CA125) in a proprietary software calculation to generate a high or low probability for malignancy score

- **Overa**
	- The relatively low specificity of OVA1 led to valid concerns by many obstetricians and gynecologists about a larger proportion of patients with benign disease being referred to specialists outside their practices. As such, additional biomarker breakthroughs have led to a second-generation OVA1 test. 
	- Initially known as OVA2, this novel assay is now trademarked as Overa. 
	- Overa replaces transthyretin and beta-2-microglobulin from OVA1 with HE4 and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) . 
	- The goals of this new assay are to improve the specificity and positive predictive value (PPV) of OVA1 while maintaining high sensitivity and negative predictive value; 
		- in addition, inclusion of FSH abrogated the need for clinicians to determine menopausal status when interpreting the results.

# IOTA -international ovarian tumor analysis
- The principal aim of the IOTA project has been to develop approaches to the evaluation of adnexal pathology using ultrasound that can be transferred to all examiners. Creating models that use simple, easily reproducible ultrasound characteristics is one approach.

# O-RADS
- The **Ovarian-Adnexal Imaging Reporting and Data System**, (**O-RADS)**, aims to ensure that there are uniform unambiguous sonographic and MRI evaluations of ovarian or other adnexal lesions, accurately assigning each lesion to a risk category of malignancy being present, and which informs the appropriate management that could be instituted. 
- For risk stratification, the O-RADS system recommends six categories (O-RADS 0–5), incorporating the range of normal to high risk of malignancy. 
- The Ovarian-Adnexal Reporting and Data System includes the following:
