	- Hi!I am Dr. Ganeshkumar from ICMR School of Public Health, National Institute of Epidemiology.Today, we are going to have a lecture on Selection of Study Population.A good choice of study subjects serves the vital purpose of ensuring that the findingin the study accurately represents the population of interest.So, that is an important part, how the selection of a study population gathers the right informationabout the health research over the population of interest.See, when we are going to a select a study population or a selection of subjects fromthe population of interest.There are 3 important things which we have to remember particularly; first number oneis that, we have to select the study subjects at an acceptable cost in terms of time andthen money.Second, we need to have an adequate size of the study population so that it controls therandom error, the adequate size is most important.Number three, your study population; the study subject should be representative enough tothe population of interest so that your findings can be generalizable to the population ofinterest.That is how in this video lecture we will be seeing, how to select a study populationwith a good representativeness?And we will be also discussing about what are all the issues and what are all the solutionsof selecting a study population?And what are the recruitment strategies in a clinical research?Whereas, how to achieve your adequate sample size and the process of sampling in a researchwill be dealt in the separate lecture.So, this lecture will not be covering about what is adequate size? and As well as, whatis the techniques or sampling techniques in selectioning the study population?Ok, In a health research, in a clinical research or a public health research, when you aregoing to select a study population, these are all the terminologies which we need tounderstand, which ideally happens over the process of doing a research.For example, in a layman term, a population is a larger area for example, population ofIndia or the population of Tamilnadu, a larger geographical area.From that population by setting up or for defining certain clinical under demographiccharacteristics, what you are trying to derive is called a target population.So, your target population is determined by certain clinical and demographic strategies,characteristics.By applying certain geographical and as well as temporal characteristics over there temporaltarget population, what you are trying to derive is a called accessible population.So, if from these accessible population by means of certain subset of this accessiblepopulation, what we are trying to derive is called Study sample.So, this is how a process of deriving a study sample from the population.So, from this step you can able to understand that two important terminologies; one is calledTarget population which is defined by clinical and demographic characteristics, second isa Accessible population which is defined by geographical under temporal characteristicsof the subset of the target population and from the subset of the accessible populationwhat we derive is a study sample.I will give one example for these; for example, our target population which based on the researchquestion, if the research question is like I want to study about what is a low dose ofmetformin to reduce the dysmenorrhea among PCOS females in reproductive age group.So in that here, when you specifically see that the clinical and demographic characteristicsare those PCOS females in the reproductive age group and they are sufferings from polycysticovarian disease and they should be having a clinical feature of dysmenorrhea.And, the geographical and temporal characteristics are defined by the accessibility of the population;this is the subset of the target population.For example, when I am going to conduct in a city and those patients who are attendingmy OPD are my accessible population and I am recruiting them for this study.So, this defines the geographical and temporal is that from January 1 to December 31st ofa year, a specified year.So, all the patients who are attending my OPD's with this clinical and demographic characteristicsin this period will be recruited for my study.And from the, I estimated sample size, I will be recruiting those subset of accessible populationcalled study samples.So, let us see how the journey of choosing the study subjects that represent the populationhappens.So, I am just throwing a kind of an algorithm here which will explains you certain two importantterminologies called External validity and Internal validity.For example, by means of a phenomena of interest; that means, by your research question yoursetting up certain clinical and demographic characteristics what to derive is a targetpopulation, and from that you have an intended sample and that intended sample you are measuringcertain intended variables and what you derive is a actual subjects, that is study subjects,and where you do your actual measurements.So, same how you do is that, you do your research, you choose your research question of the phenomenaof the interest and you have a study plan of conducting the study and measuring it withan actual measurements and that is your actual study here.So, how it happens in reverse?Say, from the findings of your study, from those actual subjects what you infer is calleda truth in the study and this truth in the study is what you are trying to infer overthe truth in the universe, so this goes in a reverse.So, you are trying to generalize your study findings over the population of interest andthat is where you have depicted as truth in the study and truth in the universe.So, here you can clearly note that there are certain errors, which may happen when youare deriving the subjects from the target population to the actual subjects.And previously, I explained that these kinds of random errors can be handled by an adequatesize of the sample population.Now, you can clearly see here that, where this external validity and internal validitylies.So, the internal validity is a kind of a degree that how far the dependent variable influencedby the independent variables and this is very much consistent within the study subjects.If it is very much consistent and that has a good internal validity and same, when thisderive, mean this findings or we are going to generalize to the population the generalizabilityis called that external validity, where the findings of the study are applied over thepopulation of interest.So, internal validity is very, very essential.So, that is a most important part when we are trying to generalize the results.So, now you could able to understand that there is some kind of trade-off between internalvalidity and generalizations.So, what happens when we are going to select representative samples from the study population?When we are choosing representative samples from the population then they are subjectto more biases and confounding than the samples that are internally valid.Then what happens when those studies with good internal validity?So, it makes any generalizations to other populations, but there is a hinge in that,what it is?The internal valid results, are not necessary be generalized to target population.So, that is how and I am trying to explain here that there is always a trade-off betweeninternal validity and generalizations.So, generalizability hardly a categorical answer of yes or no, it is very rare.It has many trade-off, it is kind of a mix where scientific unpractical decisions hasbeen taken when we are choosing the study subjects and when we are going to infer thestudy findings and applicable to the population of interest.So, it depends upon the design, it depends upon the method and also it depends upon thespecific research question and where we are applying to derive the findings.In general, generalizing the study findings can be very valid can be easily happen inclinical studies and clinical trials and analytical studies.So, generalizable of these study findings is very common.So, very popular example is say Framingham Cohort Study.So, in that Framingham cohort study what they have selected is from your individuals fromyour county called Framingham.From that, when they are selecting it whether the findings, whichever the findings of thestudy can be generalizable to the whole population of United States of America?No, it depends upon the study findings.What they have identified in Framingham is that, the association between those cardio-vascularrisk factors or the association, the strength of association of hypertension has a cardiovascularrisk factor is consistent not only to the population but also to other kind of geneticallydifferent ethnical group called Americans, Africo-Americans and all those things.Whereas, when we are trying to generalize certain other findings the prevalence of hypertension,which is identified in this Framingham study may not be generalizable to other ethnicity.So, that is how descriptive studies always have an issue that, because there the studyresults cannot be generalizable as such.It is specific to the population which it has been studied and because descriptive studiesmainly study the distribution of the characteristics of the population which may not be generalizableas like that when we are doing in analytical studies or a clinical trails.So, now, you can understand that generalizing the study findings is based on even the studydesign and the type of method and how the findings depends upon the findings, whetherit is an analytical study findings or it is a descriptive study findings, it is very important.Let us see that, the other important part of selecting the study population with healthresearch is called selection criteria.So, what is that selection criteria?So, this flow chat which you have understood already, which we have discussed already isabout that how we derive a target population by a set of clinical and demographic characteristicsand how we derive the accessible population, which is the subset of the target populationby means of geographical and temporal characteristics.So, the terminology called inclusion criteria and exclusion criteria is based on this, how?See, inclusion criteria is the main characteristics of a target population that pertain to theresearch question.So, that main characteristics means here the clinical characteristics, demographic characteristicsand often the selection criteria in terms of geographical and temporal characteristicsare defined in the inclusion criteria, who has to be included in my study.So, it depends upon these characteristics.Now, what is that external exclusion criteria.So, in exclusion criteria we are deciding in our study that who are those subjects,which we are not going to include because they might interfere in the success of thefollow-up efforts or they might interfere with the quality of the data and they mayinterfere with the acceptability of the study or even there will be interfering with theethical concerns.So, those study subjects or those groups of people with those characteristics, we do notwant to include in our study is defined as that exclusion criteria.So the step as such is that; first, we need to define a specific inclusion criteria basedon the specific inclusion criteria, what you derive is a accessible population and by meansof an exclusion criteria you are neglecting or you are avoiding to include certain individuals,so that what we are trying to derive is a subset of your accessible population calledstudy samples, with an estimated sample size in it.So, more in that inclusion criteria and exclusion criteria, here I am giving an example whatwe have discussed already.See, the study, designing a selection criteria say for a clinical trial of low dose metforminto reduce dysmenorrhea in females with the polycystic ovary.Here, let us see what how we can fix up our inclusion and exclusion criteria?So, the inclusion criteria, as we discussed already that the main characteristics of thepopulation those who have to be included in my study, which is relevant to the researchquestion and which will be very efficient to the study.So here demographic characteristics, I will include females in the reproductive age groupof 15 to 44 years; yes, it defines that particularly and the clinical characteristics are thosereproductive age group females with polycystic ovary and suffering from dysmenorrhea.And the geographical characteristics, patients attending the OPD of the hospital where thestudy is going on in the particular region and temporal characteristics is that, betweenthe period January 1 to December 31 of the specific year.So, temporal is that time.With this set of inclusion criteria, now in this study what are the exclusion criteriaI am fixing up, a subset of the population which should not be included, which cannotbe included in my study.See, when I am concerning with those subjects who will interfere with the loss to followup or chances of moving out form the study area may have a higher chance of getting dropout, loss to follow up or some amount by means of marriage, those who are potential, in thisparticular study period the loss to follow up.Number two, interfering with the quality of the data, how?For example, here in this example patient who are already in metformin therapy for someother cause may be due to diabetes.So, they may not be included in my study and what is in terms of being on high risk ofpossible adverse effects with this kind of a design feature, I will exclude those individualswho are hypersensitive to metformin therapy and contraindication for metformin is calledrenal dysfunction.So, those individuals with the renal dysfunction will also be excluded from this metformintherapy.So, that is how this gives you an idea about, in terms of selection criteria, how to fixour inclusion criteria and how to fix our exclusion criteria in the selection of studysubjects as selection criteria.With this understanding, what will be your source of the population, Clinical versusCommunity Population?.Say like, clinical population where we will include those studies where we have a researchquestion involving the patients, but the previous example those are all the PCOS reproductiveage group, females with PCOS with dysmenorrhea.If it is so, then obviously, thus source of study population obviously will be from hospitalsor from the clinic based patients.So, it is preferred that best when we need to have a good internal validity and as wellas, so that to be generalize these findings to the population of interest it is preferredwith good quality of data the source of clinical population is from the primary health careclinics.For example, when we are studying a true population; true population based sample which are ofa huge geographical area, a community based populations and which will be a very goodsource for healthy subjects, when we are trying to study over a healthy subjects, over a healthyindividuals.For example, Vaccine - efficacy studies obviously, it has to be from the community based studies.So, in this term, what is a problem here in terms of true population based study is that,it is very difficult.House to house of enumeration have a more difficulty of including them and getting thestudy subjects within the specific time period is another difficulty and it is very expensiveto recruit also.But, in terms of deriving a good public health and clinical decisions among the communitythen obviously, population based sample has to be done, which I have given the examplecalled vaccine efficacy studies.So, what will be your source of population?It depends purely upon your research question.So, let us see, what are the recruitment strategies?And what has to be considered when we are doing the recruitment of study subjects inyour study?So, what is that recruitment basically?Most important factor whenever we are going to recruit the study subject is that feasibility,because feasibility is an important factor when we are to consider to choose those accessiblepopulation and when we are trying to do a sampling procedure.Feasibility decides both, what is our sampling procedure?And how we are going to choose this accessible population from the target population?Or how we are going to choose this subset of samples from this accessible populationwhen the feasibility is an important factor?And, there are two important goals in term of recruitment, what are the goals of therecruitment?Number one goal is that the subject should be adequately representing the target population,because you are trying to select a subset of a target population by means of geographicaland temporal characteristics with predefined clinical and demographic characteristics.So, these subjects should adequately represent it, whatever the kind of findings you aretrying to infer and apply is over this target population.And second important goal is that there should be enough subject to meet the sample sizerequirement because previously we discussed that it should have an adequate size to counterthe errors the random error generated in the study so that adequate size should be there,that are the 2 important goals.Let us see that one by one, how to achieve a representative sample?Achieving a representative sample, it happens at the beginning of the design phase and endsat the implementation phase.How it happens in the design phase?And the design phase itself, we will decide, what is the choosing the population accessiblepopulation from the target population and choosing those sampling methods wisely fromthe target population can happen at the designing phase itself, Whereas, in implementation phasehow it ends?Number one is that, when you are trying to guard the errors by applying certain criteriaover a period of time; that means you have these selection criteria.By means of selection criteria what you can do in the implementation phase is that, youcan achieve this representative sample and you can exclude those individuals, who cannotgive a consistent or representative finding to the study.And second is that, unit monitor this entire study; monitor out this study subjects areadhere to this entire period, there should not be any loss to follow up and if thereis a loss to follow up how it has to be guarded?And, that is what we are trying to discuss in the next slide.So, as an overall what you can see is that, when you are achieving a representative samplewhich is begin at the design phase and it ends in the implementation phase.So, as I told that something called Non responses in the study that is called loss to followup and non responsive rate.This non responses in the study is basically happen more in observational studies and veryleast in clinical trials and in this, it influences the validity of your findings, which representsthe study population and most important thing, third is that it compromise your generalizability.So, two things are affected very important; number one is that, internal validity willbe affected when there is a non-responsive rate there is a loss to follow which reducesyour sample size requirement and second is that, the representativeness and generalizabilitywill also be affected.So, these are the two important things because of this non-response rate.But, how we can able to tackle these non-responses in the study?Then say, at the initial instance where you could able to get the adequate size and theperson is not responding or not available, then repeated contact attempts may give youor may give you an access to the recruit them again into your study.And second is that, design that avoids discomfort to the participants by after they got recruitedin between, if they have a loss to follow-up how to tackle this, that.You can play some kind incentive mechanism, you can take away certain discomforts like,there should not be too sensitive an instrument should be, which should not be invasive.So, you can try to not disturbing in your other technique in the study or methodologyin the study, you can still think of designing certain study instruments which has to bein the local language of them, which it has to be understandable and those interviewersshould talk in their local language to the participant.So, the bilingual staff with the translated questionnaire may reduce the discomfort ofthe study subjects.So, by these mind of a mechanisms, it is where we could able to tackle of recruiting thisadequate samples at the beginning itself and as well as where we could able to tackle tostop them loss to follow up while the study is going on.And finally, I am trying to give a summary of how this selection of study populationin a step by manner can happen.So, in the first step what happens is that, we define a target population by a specificset of inclusion criteria by means of a clinical demography, geographical and temporal characteristics.Second is that, this accessible population is again by specific set of inclusion criteriaas said by geographical and temporal characteristics.Third step is that, what we are deriving is a subset of this accessible population, whichwe are excluding by setting up some kind of exclusion criteria because we are eliminatingthe subjects which are unethical and also inappropriate to study.Fourth step is that, we are doing a sampling procedure here, so by defining the samplingtechnique and by then estimated sample size which is large enough to control the randomerror will be done in the fourth step.And finally in the fifth step, is a recruitment strategy where we are trying to recruit thoseadequate subjects and as well as those subjects by those recruitment strategies to reducethe non response rate and as well as last to follow-up.So, that is how this is where the important considerations has to be think of about selectingthe study population for your health research.

	- In our course of Health Research Fundamentals, today we are going to discuss Study plan andproject management.It is really critical that lot of energy and time is spent by all who are involved in theproject or in the research study plan development in planning it really well.Because, only a well planned study succeeds.Most of the times if we have not thought of all the eventualities, will land up in certainsituations where there are difficulties which are faced while implementing the study andalso while interpreting the study.And today, what we are trying to discuss is what kind of systematic process or approachcan be taken to ensure that the project is implemented appropriately or the study isimplemented appropriately.What is important in project management is to ensure that the defined objectives areadequately met and there are certain deliverables, which are defined right at the beginning ofthe study that this is what we want to achieve, which is our definition of objectives, andso they should be reached within the defined time frame and with the available budget notcompromising the quality at all.So, all this is achieved through effective project management.Primarily, because what we do is the project if it ends successfully the result shouldbe able to provide direction for future implications, basically what it means is whatever researchwe do it should help us to do something better tomorrow.It is important that we understand that any kind of implementation process involves somekind of underlying principle, with a primary objective of achieving a specific goal.Let me take an example of the process of resource allocation and resource management.Well, the principle here is appropriate time management.The resources have to be allocated in a timely manner, if it is going to be a long term studyit will be on multiple occasions that the resources will have to be mobilized.So, that timing really becomes very critical because only then we are able to achieve thegoal of efficient, we can progress efficiently towards achievement of our goals.Another critical aspect in the process is planning and scheduling the activities.This is the important principle which undergoes behind that and to ensure that, this happensis the monitoring and supervision.Every single detail has to be planned out appropriately so that when we reach the goal,we reach it with the best possible quality standard and hence it is important to keepthis whole process in mind and the principles in mind.Ad hoc decisions which are taken or ad hoc approach which is taken while conducting researchstudy often becomes non-productive.So, there can be lot of confusion at the beginning of the study in the minds of people.So, like I want do a study, but I am not clear about what the objectives are.I have prepared a questionnaire, but I am not clear about exactly what information Ineed.I also feel that I will be able to collect the data, but I am not clear how will I useit.All these kinds of confusions arise because the investigator himself has not understoodwhat the research is all about.What is going to happen as a result of this?This is going to result in a disaster, because this will be a situation which will lead toproduction of data or compilation of data which is difficult to analyze or then theanalyzed data becomes difficult to interpret and even if the interpretations are made probablythey are of no use to the program or also in the policy making.So, eventually what it means is any kind of an ad hoc approach, ad hoc approach whichis taken without proper thought being given to that is not likely to succeed.Any research process typically starts with identifying the need for that particular research,then correctly verbalizing the research question or spelling out the research question, formulatingthe study objectives, planning the analysis, then preparing data collection instruments,then collecting data, analyzing data, drawing appropriate conclusions, making the specificrecommendations to the concerned people and eventually again accessing, whether our needsthat we had initially identified have been fulfilled or not or whether there is any needto do anything else.If we look at this whole process, in terms of identifying data needs and spelling outthe question this all is the planning stage or the initial stage even while the studyis being conceptualized.This is a pre-planning phase.The steps of formulating the objectives and the analysis plan and deciding about the studyinstrument methodology, where the way in which data will be analyzed and then the way itwill be interpreted, this all is a part of analysis plan.And, what we do after that is the dissemination of these findings to the concerned stake holdersso that they can use it for appropriate programmatic absorption or policy making.So, basically the road map to study planning and management involves multiple steps.It all starts with formulating appropriate objective for the study, then choosing theright design to determine the key indicators.Please understand, I am going to walk you through this particular thing but proper decisionabout what kind of study is required to answer the objectives that we have framed is verycritical and important one.We have to also identify the parameters that are needed to estimate the indicators thatwe find, that we have decided, that are important for this particular study and then preparethe analysis out line.Also, important to estimate the sample size before the study is initiated, because thestudy conducted on a small sample also will be not generalizable.When we talk about the study objectives, the basic principle is fewer the better.Most of the studies with a long list of objectives often become very confused studies becausemany of these objectives remain unfulfilled, because they become complex, the data collectiontools increase, there are lots of variations that come in while collecting the data andin general there is a chaos.So, fewer the better is the principle.They can be described.Objectives can be described as primary objectives and secondary objectives.It is important, the primary objective is important because that generally decides thesample size for that particular study.Often in any study, sample size is calculated based on the presumption that we should beable to achieve the primary end point at least.Secondary end points are the analyzable issues, which are the additional information, piecesof information that we obtain in any research study.But it is important that the objectives are clearly phrased.Normally, they could be of 2 types, they could be more of a exploratory type or what we callit as aimed at testing a hypothesis and here is, where we use the word determine.So, determine whether a contaminated well caused an outbreak that is an example.Or they could be say sort of confirmatory in nature or estimating in nature, say toactually decide the prevalence of a particular condition, for example, diabetes in a population.So, we have to keep in mind and use the appropriate verbs while defining the objectives.There are different types of study designs, which are adopted to answer various researchquestions.Whenever we talk about or whenever we think about descriptive objectives, whenever weare exploring the acute conditions like for example, pneumonia case is occurring in children,the right kind of designs or diarrheas occurring in children and etiology.The right kind of designs would be to do cohort studies or surveillance studies which aremay be hospital based surveillance or community based surveillance.And normally, the major that you derive out of it is, incidence; this is true in caseof acute conditions.But when we talk about chronic conditions, once that conditions occurs it persist fora long time either on treatment or not on treatment.So, the major that we normally get out of such kinds of studies is prevalence.And here, the right kind of designs to be used are either the cross-sectional studiesor the cohort studies.Well, many of the epidemiological studies deal with comparing 2 groups say for example,people who are exposed to a particular condition not exposed to a particular condition, peoplesuffering from a particular disease not suffering from a particular disease, and so wheneverwe are moving from the variable or the exposure to the outcome, we call it as cohort study.As we know it is a prospective assessment and whenever we try to look at the exposureafter the outcome has already developed it is called as a retrospective approach andoften the commonest study design which is employed is a case control study here.But, what is important to understand and remember here is a cohort study can be undertaken onlywhen the outcome is more likely to occur frequently, because if it is going to take a long timeto happen then probably the study will be of enormously long period and the adequatenumber of outcomes may not be achieved.So, for a frequently occurring outcome which, wherein from exposure to the outcome the lengthis likely to be minimal, cohort study is a good approach to take or alternatively a crosssectional analytical study can be under taken; but in case of rare exposures and where theduration between the exposure and the outcome is likely to be very long, then it is betterto go for a case control approach and in these situations the relative risk and odds ratio.In case of cohort studies, it is the relative risk which we obtain which is a more definitivesay indicator of relationship and odds ratio is also is a strong indicator of association.It is important that the discussion in the planning stage focuses a lot on the informationneeds that with respect to the indicators.There are rates that we calculate, sometimes we calculate ratios or proportions etcetera,but for all of these indicators we do need a numerator and we do need a denominator.We have to understand exactly how we are going to collect the information that is going tobe required to determine the numerator also the denominator.But sometimes, this relationship between the exposure and the outcome also is affectedby lot of other co-variates, they are called as risk factors or con-founders and I willdiscuss some of them.But the basic principles that we have to follow while we collect the information elementsis that, we must use the variables which will be actually analyzable, this information wecan obtain by reviewing the literature fairly scrupulously because it provides us a lotof evidence of which variables co-variates are important.It is important to also use validated or standardized methods because then the chances that thisparticular study will be accepted globally are maximum.We must adopt standardized case definition, for example, when we are going to talk aboutpneumonia; what is pneumonia?We should define it properly.If we are going to talk about smoking, this as an exposure variable, what is that we aregoing to consider as smoking?Is it the frequency of smoking?Is it, yes or no?Or the number of cigarettes smoked per day?We have to have clarity on these matters.Sometimes, we also use laboratory criteria and so we have to have also well defined definitionsthere, for example, if you have to define anemia; how do we define anemia here?Does it depend on age?Does it depend on gender?All these have to be specified right in the beginning; we have to then decide which isthe most reliable and accurate way of collecting that information.Sometime it could be just the observation or it is a questionnaire through which wecollect this information or it could be actually laboratory assay through which we get thisinformation.For example, if we are going to talk about as an outcome, whether there is an evidenceof chronic iodine deficiency.The way to look at it is, we would look at what is the say prevalence of goitre in aspecified community, and how we will do it is by actually doing physical examination.But if our objective is to find out what is the current exposure to the iodine here?What we would try to do is, at an individual level try to estimate the urine iodine excretionand for this we would require some laboratory methods to actually estimate this.But sometimes, it also becomes important to go one step behind and find out what are thedietary patterns?Is there an adequate iodine being provided through the diet?And so, what one would want to do is to test the household salt for iodine and this wouldinvolve some kind of field level spot test which are done to figure out, whether thesalt which is consumed in the various households actually has enough iodine in them.I did mention about the risk factors, about the confounding factors.There are certain risk factors like income and the community which are related to accessfor example, or the level of literacy, the practices, cultural and social which are observedby the community, the dietary patterns all these also influence the outcome.Then they also have to be appropriately analyzed when we do the interpretation of our results.Similarly, with age the risks sometimes vary with gender, the risks vary the residence,they also vary.They are considered as confounding factors, if they affect both the exposure as well asthe outcome variable.There is no harm, even if the confounders are there, provided we have collected informationon all of the confounders as a part of our study and in the questionnaire.We can always analyze the effect of the confounders.It is important to make the analysis plan because it helps to focus on the objectivesof the study.This all thing can start by once, if you have clarity in our mind, what study we are doing.We can also prepare dummy tables right in the beginning of the study because then weknow what we must do and what we must not do.We also know what data we should collect and what data we no need to collect because itsaves time.It can result in to quick publication and quick dissemination of findings and earlypolicy feedback.So, this is important to make a good analytical plan.Sample size is really critical because it is decided by what exactly is the type ofoutcome assessment that we are doing; whether it is by measurement or by testing.What kind of study design we are doing?Whether it is a cohort study, case control study or a survey and whether it is a descriptivestudy or an analytical study.This is in itself is a sort of a big lecture point and so what is important to understandis when a study is being planned, it is important to involve a statistician, who would helpyou to analyze, help you to determine the sample size for the study.Often it happens that the studies fail, why do the studies fail?It is because, either they are badly defined research questions or objectives are not correctlydefined.The time skills that have been decided either are too short or too long.Sometimes, the staff is inappropriate, incompetent.This might be because of lack of correct direction, lack of motivation or lack of training.So, all these have to be taken care of.Or sometimes, it can also result from everything else is right, but there is no adequate monitoringand there is a failure to respond to contingency situations and carry out mid-course correctionsthat is where monitoring and supervision becomes important.So, for success of any kind of a study there are certain attention points one has to lookat.And they start with human resource management, a very critical aspect.The study staff has to be carefully chosen, appropriately trained and with appropriatecommunication there should be a good dialogue.Only, generally the observation is a team succeeds, but the individuals fail.And so, between the various members of the team, there should be good bonding, extremelygood communication and the leader has to ensure that this often team meetings take place andthis rapport between individuals builds strongly.Time management essentially is the responsibility of the leader, and one has to ensure thatthis is taken due care of.Time management in terms of appropriately scheduling various activities ensuring thatthey are done in time, this is really important.Financial management is also critical.Sometimes it so happens that the study starts well with the funding being given, but suddenlysome kind of glitch develops by which the finances are not being granted or given ina continuous manner, suddenly the activities of the project stop.And hence, this also is an important part of the planning.This has to be planned well in advance at what stage what kind of money will be releasedand it must be ensured by the researchers that targets which are defined well in advanceare appropriately met.So, the financier does not find it difficult to release the money what is earlier decidedon.Quality management at all levels is critical.Quality management in data collection, various clinical procedures, data management, variouslaboratory procedures, in supervisory visits, every single aspect of a study that we canthink of quality is really critical and if that is maintained then often the studiesare very successful.Data management is important.Often the studies that take care of data management in a timely manner, where concurrent datamanagement is planned they are able to give away the results in a timely manner.If the researchers have not planned it well and then they decide to do the data managementat the end of this study, often it is disaster because if there are some issues that arehappening in the way the data is being collected, if the data is being managed in a timely manner,somebody is looking at it, finding the faults in it, there is a possibility to make a change,do necessary corrections this opportunity gets lost if we are handling this whole issueat the end.I did talk about team work and coordination, which is really critical and important.And monitoring the progress and target, here it is to be decided depending on the budgetwhether it is an internal mechanism that is set up for the supervision and monitoringof the study or an external monitor is brought in to take care of what is happening in thisparticular study.But, this is again a very important step.Whether it is a research project or it is any other project, there are various aspectsthat we have to think about; it is a teamwork, it is about communication, it is about humanresource management, it is about time management, all these factors are important and we succeedas a team.Thank you for your attention.
### Designing data collection tools
- Information collected with data collection tools can be divided in to 3 types
	- ![[Pasted image 20220302002428.png]]
- Different tools to collect data
	1. Abstraction form: Review of records
	    - Personal records
	    - Clinical records
	    - Surveillance records
	    - Registers 
	2. Structured observation guide: Checklist of items
	    - Text
	    - Figures
	3. Questionnaire 
		- Interviewer-administered
		    - Face-to-face
		    - Telephone
		    - Computer-assisted 
	    - Self-administered
		    - Paper-based
		    - Computer-assisted
- Key elements of data collection tools 
	- ![[Pasted image 20220302003130.png]]
- 4 components of the data collection tool
	- ![[Pasted image 20220302003258.png]]
- **Open questions**
    - Answers are not suggested
    - Respondents must generate an answer
    - Advantages
	    - Give freedom of response
	    - Stimulate memory
	    - Can be useful to generate closed responses later
	    - Useful at a hypothesis raising stage
    - Inconvenient
	    - Difficult to code and analyze
	    - May be incomplete and / or unfocused 
	- Examples:
	    - What disease can you acquire from tobacco?
	    - What places did you eat at in the week preceding the disease?
- **Open questions with closed-end answers**
    - No option of answer is suggested
    - However, among the answers freely mentioned, the interviewer will tick those spontaneously specified
    - Expressed as an open question
    - Analyzed as a closed-end question 
    - Example: What are the practices that may increase your risk to get a heart attack? (DO NOT propose any option of answer)
		a. Lack of exercise (Yes/No)
		b. Smoking (Yes/No)
		c. Poor dietary practices (Yes/No)
		d. Eating too much salt (Yes/No)
- **Closed questions**: 
	1. Dichotomous options
	    - Suggested answers include 2 options only
			- Yes and No
			- Male and female
	    - Advantages
		    - Forces a clear position
		    - May be useful for key, important, well framed issues
	    - Inconvenient
		    - May oversimplify issues 
		- Examples:
		    - Did you eat at restaurant X between 1 and 28 February?
		    - Have you ever consumed tobacco products? A dichotomous question here is likely to over-simplify, unless it is used as an introduction
	2. Multiple options
	    - Multiple options of answers are suggested
	    - One or multiple answers acceptable
	    - Advantage
		    - Larger choice of answer options
	    - Inconvenient
		    - May be difficult to choose only one option 
	    - Example:
			- Where do you go to seek treatment for fever?
				- Government Hospital
				- Private clinic
				- Pharmacist
				- Traditional healer
			- Do you wear a helmet when riding a bike?
				- Always
				- Sometimes
				- Never
	3. Quantitative answers
	    - The respondent must provide a quantified answer
	    - Advantage
		    - Allows creation of continuous variables
	    - Inconvenient
		    - May requires validation:
			    - Some *quantified* answers might be limited in the way they can be handled as continuous variables
		- Examples:
		    - How many time did you visit the clinic in the last 12 months?
			    - True continuous variable
			    - Four visits is the double of two visits
		    - How would you describe your pain on a 1-10 scale where 1 would be the minimum and 10 would be the maximum?
			    - In fact a qualitative variable with 10 options
			    - Requires validation
			    - Six may not be the double of three on the scale
- **Semi-open questions**
    - Suggested answers
    - Possibility to create another answer
	    - Other, specify: ________
    - Advantage
	    - Leaves the door open to unplanned answers
    - Inconvenient
	    - Difficult to analyze
	- Example:
	    - Did your child have complication following measles?
		    - None
		    - Pneumonia
		    - Diarrhoea
		    - Eye problems
		    - Other, specify: ________
- *Formulating questions*
    - Write short and precise questions
	    - Full and complete phrases
	    - Avoid ambiguities
    - Use simple words of every day language
    - Avoid negatives and double negatives 
	    - ~~Do you sometimes care for patients without washing hands?~~ 
	    - Do you systematically wash hands before caring for each patient?
    - Ask only one question at the time 
	    - ~~Did you refuse treatment because you feared side effects?~~ 
		    - Did you refuse treatment? 
		    - If yes, was this because you feared side effects?
    - Be specific 
	    - ~~Are you aware of the modes of transmission of HIV?~~ 
	    - Among these practices, can you tell me those that could expose you to HIV?
    - Use neutral tone to avoid influence 
	    - ~~Have you been promiscuous in the last six months? ~~
	    - How many partners have you had in the last six months?
- Sorting the *order of questions* 
	- From simple to complicated
	- From general to specific 
	- From casual to intimate
	- Group together questions related to the same topic 
	- Identification questions at the beginning or at the end
	- In chronological order, if questions related to sequence of events
	- Introduce simple questions as a break if the questionnaire is complex
	- Triangulate through multiple questions on the same topic if the subject is important
- Laying out the data collection tool
	- ![[Pasted image 20220302005615.png]]
- Finalizing the data collection tool 
	1. Checking the instrument against the objectives/analysis plan
	    - Suppress unnecessary questions
	    - Add missing questions 
	2. Reviewing the instrument
	    - Colleagues
	    - Experts
	    - Statisticians (Coding)
	    - Field workers
	    - Data entry operators 
	3. Language of the instrument
	    - Write in the language in which they will be administered
	    - Translation is required
		    - Initial formulation (e.g., in English)
		    - Translation (e.g., in Hindi)
		    - Back-translation (e.g., back to English)
- Pilot testing the data collection tool
    - Check that the instrument is:
	    - Clear
	    - Understandable
	    - Acceptable
    - Check flow and skip pattern
    - Check pertinence of coding
    - Estimate the time needed to ask all the questions
    - Pilot test with a few volunteers
	    - Persons similar to the study population
	    - Persons who are not to be included in the study
- Designing health research tools

- (Video Transcript)
	- Hello and welcome to this session of Health Research Fundamentals.Today, we are going to talk about designing data collection tools or the instruments thatwe use to collect data in health research.Generally, in health research, the kind of information that we would like to collectcan be basically divided into three areas.We want to know facts such as, the characteristics of our study participants, the environmentthat they live in and their behaviors or practices.Secondly, we might want to know their level of knowledge for things such as, risk factorsfor getting disease or knowledge about healthy lifestyle, so as to prevent diseases and thirdlyand very importantly we might want to collect information on what we call the domain ofjudgments, basically what are the opinions of the research participants on a certainissue, may be such as quality of health services.We would also may, we may want to know about the respondentâ€™s attitudes towards certainthings for example, could be something as wearing seat belts, use of open defecationand so forth.Now, how do we collect data on all these different kinds of information that we want to collect.For this purpose, we can make use of a variety of tools depending on what kind of data wewould like to collect.One, we have what are called abstraction forms, which is basically doing a review of recordsof the study participants, which could be their personal records, the forms.If you want to get information on their disease conditions, signs and symptoms, a treatmentgiven, then we could look at the clinical records.We could look at data in general, the data that is collected through disease surveillanceand we could also look at registers, wherein some information, which may be there and allof this information can be culled out into what we want, in the form of a data abstractionform.Secondly, another tool that we have for collecting data is a structured observation guide.This is very useful when we would like to document certain processes, whether they arehappening, the way they are happening, that they are happening in time or not, are theobjectives met and for this purpose we may use a check list of items that we would liketo collect data on which could be the textual or figurative and third and most importantly,the tool that is used most commonly is a questionnaire, wherein we would like, we talk to the personand get information.Now, again questionnaires can be divided into two kinds - it could be interviewer administered,where the data collector actually administers the questions to the respondents, which couldbe done either face to face, it could be done on a telephone and now even have computer-assistedtechnologies to do face to face interviews.The questionnaires could also be self administered, if the study participants can read and writeand they are knowledgeable enough to understand what the investigators want.These could again be either paper based or now we also have computer assisted self administeredquestionnaire which can help the respondents to directly put their information into a computerdatabase.Now, whatever the tool of data collection we use, what we want is that we need a validresponse from the study participant.The response should make sense and we should be able to use that information effectivelyfor our health research needs.In order to do that, every data collection tool needs to make sure that there are somekey elements that make up this data collection tool.Some of these elements are the clarity of words that you use in a data collection tool,the balance of phrases and sentences, the length of sentences; how long are these questions,the comprehensiveness of the responses in terms, if you are giving categories of responsesthat you expect from the study participants.These categories can actually even post constraints in terms of what information could or couldnot be collected through a data collection tool.Of course the utility of the data collection tool and specially the utility of the instructions;which I will elaborate in the next slides.The order in which the questions are asked is a very important element which can decidehow your respondents answer your questions and of course, the context in which you framethese questions and the tools are used.So, if we look at any data collection tool generically it has 4 components, there isthe introduction part at the beginning and a conclusion at the end.There are what are called identifiers, then the each question may have linked instructionsfor the data collectors and of course, the whole body of the instruments which is basicallythe question items.In terms of the introduction, the introduction is used to present the study to the studyparticipants, state out the objectives and probably get informed consent and so forth.It is also good to always have a concluding statement at the end of your questionnaireand thank the study participant for their time and effort that they have put in to answeryour questions.Now, every data collection tool will also have what we called identifiers, which couldbe either the actual identifiers, the information such as the name and address of the studyparticipant, which can identify who the person is, it is always a good idea from an ethicaland a human subject protection perspective, if you are collecting this data, to collectthis in a separate sheet of paper and which can be referred to later on, if need be.On the other hand, in order to maintain confidentiality investigators also use coded id numbers togive identifiers to the study participants and these id numbers could be composite insuch that they could have numbers which denote say, the state which the person belongs tothe district the village and then the household and then the individual id.So, it could be a mix of all these numbers, all these codes and then you get a compositecode looking at which you can actually identify who the respondent is, but would not be ableto actually get an exact identification and which is good from the confidentiality perspective.In terms of the instructions, there could be general instructions for the data collectorssuch as prompts in terms of, for example, do not read out all the responses, tick onlythe one that the study participant mentions.There could be instructions for skip patterns, now the questionnaires may have skip patternsin the sense that there may be some questions which, based on the response to those, thesubsequent question may not be relevant and then there is an instruction, which says thatyou skip this from question 2, you may go to say question 19 and skip rest of the questionsbecause they are not relevant to this study participant.It is also always a good idea to may be used different fonts, so as to make it clear thatwhat is the actual question and which part of the item is actually an instructions forthe data collector and then of course, we have the whole body of the instrument whichis basically the question items.Now, these question items could be of various types, we could have what are called openquestions, we could have closed ended questions and we could have somewhere, something inthe middle.Let us see what are these different types of questions.As the name suggests open questions are the once where the answers are not suggested tothe study participants and the respondent has to generate an answer.The good thing about these questions is, it gives total freedom to the respondent to givethe answer of what they want.They are not constrained by the categories of answers that already are existing.It helps to stimulate the memory of the research participant and gives you a more better answerswho as to speak and it is also useful at hypothesis raising stage, wherein we are really not surewhat the appropriate answer is and you can generate a lot of responses from the studyparticipants.Of course, when you generate a lot of responses, open questions, the inconvenience is thatit may be difficult to code and analyse.You may have a long list of responses and then to categorize them later may be an issueand sometimes, if it is open, the responses may be unfocused or incomplete and that canpose a challenge in terms of the analysis.Now, to overcome this problem, we can have open questions, but then we can have thenwith closed ended answers.Although, there is a category of answers given for those that question, but the data collectordoes not suggest an answer from these categories to the study participant.So, when the answers are freely mentioned by the respondent the interviewer will spontaneouslytick those that are specified from the list of categories of responses given in the questionhere.So, it is expressed as an open question, but you finally analyse this as a closed endedquestion.What are closed questions?Closed questions are the once, where you have a question and you have a set category ofanswers only which are the once that are acceptable to this investigator.These could be two types, we could have Closed questions with only two options, dichotomousoptions such as yes-no, male-female and so forth.So, these kind of questions forces a clear position for the respondent to take and itis very useful to get key information specially for important issues and which is very focused.Although sometimes depending on the question it may actually over simplify some of theissues, where a yes-no answer is not something that is going to give you a very good information.Then we have Closed questions with multiple options, so more than two options.Now here again, they can be two kinds of Closed questions with multiple options.We could have questions where although there are multiple options, only one of the optionis acceptable.So, depending on what the respondent says, one of this option is ticked by the data collector.On the other hand, we could have closed ended questions with multiple options, wherein evenmultiple responses by the study participants may be acceptable.The important thing to note is that, while you are designing the questionnaire you needto put a clear instruction for the data collector, whether only one answer is acceptable forthis question or more than one answer may be acceptable.So, we have a large choice of answer options; again depending on how the question is framedand what the actual question is, sometimes it may become inconvenient and difficult tochoose only one option, if there is a possibility of more than one option, but that possibilityis not provided in the questionnaire.So, we have to be mindful of this when you are designing your questionnaires.And thirdly, we could have Closed questions which have quantitative answers, where therespondent has to provide a number, such as age, such as may be one example here, if yousee; how many times did you visit the clinic in the last 12 months?These kind of questions allows the creation of continuous variables and then measuringand doing the analysis for continuous variables.If you need we can always categorize these variables later on in the time of analysisif needed.However, sometimes it can become inconvenient to give a quantitative answer because somequantified answers may be limited in the way they can be handled as continuous variablesand where the number itself is difficult to interpret.So, we need to be careful in how we are framing these kinds of questions.Then there we could have something called, which are called semi-open questions, whereyou basically have a question with several responses, the answers here are suggested,but there may be one option where, which is kept open and the most common one that wesee in data collection tools and questionnaires is others.For example, did your child have complication following measles?There could not have been any complication, that could be pneumonia, diarrhea, eye problemsor there could be some other complications, which may not be so common so as to be putin a category, but then you give an option to the respondent to even say things otherthan what is in the list of categories of responses.So, it leaves the door open for unplanned answers; however, if there are too many ofthese responses, it may sometimes become difficult to analyze.Now, let us look at, how some of the principles and doâ€™s and donâ€™ts of formulating thequestions.It is always the good idea to actually have short and precise questions, say for example,if you want to know the age of your study participant, just writing age is not a goodidea.You should always use full and complete phrases, so, what is your age?So avoiding ambiguities.It is a good idea to use simple words and not use very complicated academic language,use everyday language in terms of questions because again remember that your are respondentsare lay people.When you are formulating questions, again it is good idea to avoid negatives; especiallydouble negatives.So, one example that we have here is, do you sometimes care for patients without washinghands.If you see carefully, there is a negative connotation here, and there are sort of twoparts of the questions, one is caring for patients and the other one is washing handsor without washing hands.So, a better way to phrase this question could be to ask it directly and more positively,so, do you systematically wash hands before caring for each patient?, which makes it clearand unambiguous.Again when you ask a question, it should be only one question at a time; say one examplehere that we have here, so, did you refuse treatment because you feared side effects?.Now, here actually we have two questions; one is asking: did you refuse treatment?And the other is trying to find out the reason of why, if the person refuse treatment, whydid they do so.It may be that the respondent may not have refused treatment then how does that respondentanswer this question.So, it is a good idea to actually split such questions into two questions, where in onecould be first; the first part say could be, did you refuse treatment?Depending on yes or no, if the answer is yes, the following question could be; was thisbecause you feared side effects?It makes things very clear.Again, the questions need to be specific and not vague, so an example that we have hereis say, you want to know from the people about how HIV is transmitted and the question is:Are you aware of the modes of transmission of HIV? which is sort of an open ended, itleaves space for people to answer whatever they may want to answer.But if you really want to know whether HIV is transmitted through sexual route, throughheterosexual route, homosexual route, blood transfusion, drug use, etcetera, then it isbetter to actually put these as categories of responses and then phrase the questionas, among these practices can you tell me those that could expose you to HIV.So, you know that you are going to get the proper answer to the question in which youwanted to have.It is also a good idea to always use a neutral tone and avoid judgmental tones, which caninfluence the response of the study participants.Remember that you are there as a data collector to just collect data and not be judgmentalof what the respondent is telling you.One example that we have here, so if you want to know about say the sexual practices ofpeople, instead of asking them have you been promiscuous in the last 6 months?Again, the words promiscuous has a negative connotation , so instead of that it couldbe more neutral and more academic kind of a question, wherein you just be direct andspecific and ask about: How many partners have you had in the last 6 months? withoutbeing too judgmental.. Now, the next thing that you would want todo, when you are designing your questionnaire is, to actually sort out what would be theorder of the questions that you have.Remember that, the way in which you ask questions should be such as if your having a conversationwith a study participant and it should be a smooth flow of questions one after the otherlinked to one another.Some general principles to keep in mind is that always ask simple questions first andkeep the complicated questions for the later part.You can ask more general questions, socio demographic characteristics, like that, andthen go on to the specific questions of what your study is all about.Ask more casual questions in the beginning, which the respondent will be easy to answer;more of factual questions and then more intimate questions, sensitive issues, questions aboutattitudes and opinions could be something that could come later on.It is always again a good idea, remember, to actually group together all the questionswhich are related to the same topic of inquiry instead of having them spread across differentparts of the questionnaire, which can actually confuse the respondent.In terms of asking the identification questions either they can all be asked at the end interms of the name, age, gender, say the address and so forth or they could even be asked atthe end so as to get to the specifics right at the beginning.If you are trying to collect information about a sequence of events, then your questionsshould be in that proper chronological order of how things would have happened in realtime, which will actually help the respondent to recall the responses in a better way andalso in a more logical way.Again, if your questionnaire is complex, there are lots of questions, it is always good togive a break in the middle and may be have some simple questions and then come back toyour complex questions.Many a times, we may ask the same kind of question in different ways in the same questionnaireand then that is used, if that is the subject matter that is really important for the studyand you really want to know what the respondent is telling you make sense is valid is trueand then.So, the multiple questions on the same topic could be asked at different places in thequestionnaire and then when you are trying to analyze it, you can triangulate these responsesto get to what information you would like to extract from this questions.Once you have sorted out the order, now what is needed is to actually lay out all thesequestions in the questionnaire.Again remember, laying out the format, the structure of the questionnaire is again criticalbecause the way the respondents look at the questionnaire, the design and look of thequestionnaire influences or can influence the response of the participants.So, if you have different sections in the questionnaire, it is a good idea to splitthe sections, have one section, may be have line and then have the next section.Do not try to cramp questions all together, have spaces between the questions, so thatit is readable clearly.Try to use large fonts, not too small fonts so may be font size of 11 or 12 would be ideal.Again, do not split questions across pages.If you have a question and then if half of it goes to the next page, it becomes difficultfor the data collector to actually read the question, you will have to turn the page andso forth.So, if that is happening, make sure that you sort of bring the whole question on one page.In terms of formatting and aligning, alignments are again, gives you a nice, neat look forthe questionnaire.So, it is a good idea to actually align your questions on the left hand side and your answersand codes on the right hand side, which gives a neat two column kind of a look to your questionnaire,which makes it more appealing.Do not forget to number your questions starting from 1, 2 and whatever that you have.Again, one very important thing to keep in mind is coding.Remember that ultimately what you are going to do is use this data and to enter it intosoftware, give it codes to analyze it.So, it is always a good idea, to actually have a coding system inbuilt in the questionnaireitself.So, you need to standardize your coding.So wherever say, the simplest example I could give you is, a yes-no.So, you could have a code of 1 for yes and 0 for no, for example.Make sure that every question, every response where you have yes, no; you have coded itas 1, 0.Say you have male, female.So, you always code the male may be as one and the female as two or something like that.Another way to actually simplify this coding is to use what we call as auto-coding.So, the numbers that you give to the categories, say you have four response categories.So, you would number them 1, 2, 3, 4 and if say the response is number 2, then you usethe same number 2, as a code for this question item.So, these are some of the ways in which you make sure that the layout of your questionnaireis neat and it is presentable and it something that helps both the data collector as wellas the data entry operator and the person who is going to enter and analyze the dataat the later stage.When you are finalizing your data collection tool, make sure that the questions that youhave are something that is relevant to the study that you are doing.So, as may have been mentioned in earlier sessions, the investigator needs to be a slaveof the study objectives and the analysis that is already pre-planned for the study.So, make sure that the questions that you have are relevant to answer those study objectives.Do not put unnecessary questions just because you are going out in the field and doing astudy does not mean that you can ask anything and everything and if you feel that thereare certain missing questions make sure to add them.Once you have done all this, it is also a good practice to actually review your instrumentbefore you take it to the field.The reviews could be done by your colleagues and experts in the field, you could also giveit to the statisticians, to actually review look at the coding; whether that is goingto be something that is going to be useful for them and then you could even the fieldworkers or the data collectors, who are going to actually collect the data, they can beyour key informants to actually go through the questionnaire and tell you whether theflow is appropriate, whether the questions make sense, is there any ambiguity or is theresomething that is not understood and so forth.Keep in mind that the language of the instrument; the questionnaire or the data abstractionform or so forth has to be in the language in which you are going to interview the studyparticipants.So, if your study participants speak Tamil, then the questionnaire should be in Tamil,if it is Hindi, it should be in Hindi.Generally, as investigators, English is the common language, so may be your initial formulationof the questionnaire would be in English.Then what you need is a translation, you need to translate it into the local language andthen very importantly have somebody else do a back translation into English, so as tomake sure that the translated version in the local language makes the same sense as youwanted it to be and when you frame those questions in English.Before going to the field it is always important to pilot test your tools.You need to make sure that your study instrument is clear, the questions that you have askedare understandable to the people and they are acceptable, people are not wary of answeringthose questions.You need to check the flow and the skip patterns.Make sure that the coding works and it also gives you a sense of how much time it is goingto take for you to actually finish the questionnaire.All this can be done by doing a pilot testing by actually administering this questionnaireto a few volunteers who are similar to the study population that you are going to do,but remember that these people on which you pilot test your questionnaire, should notbe included later on in the main study.So, when we are designing the health research tools, we need to keep certain principlesin mind.You need to first make sure, what is it that you want to measure, remember epidemiologyis all about measuring.Then you need to relate these concepts to your study designs and the study objectives.You need to match the scales, how you are going to measure these to and then how youare going to do the analysis.Make sure that the scales, the questions, the questionnaires, the data collection toolsthat you are using are reliable and valid for the population that you are going to applythem to.Taking all these things in mind, choose the most appropriate method of data collection;whether it is a data abstraction form or a structured observation guide or a questionnaireand the type of questions that you are going to put in these data collection instruments.Keep in mind your study participants, in terms of the language of the questionnaire and alsothe way in which you are trying to measure the concepts that you are doing and then decidefinally, how best you are going to ask the actual question in the study questionnaire.Remember, a study questionnaire can make or break the study; this is something, once youhave collected data you may not have the opportunity to go back.So, it is essential that the data that you collect is valid and reliable and in orderto do that, it is key that the data collection instruments that you develop are totally validand appropriate to the study that you are trying to conduct.That is it for today.Thank you.

	- Welcome to this session of Health Research Fundamentals.Today, we will be discussing about Principles of data collection.As you all might have gone through various parts of this course, wherein we had beenteaching you about, how you develop your research proposal?How you write your protocol?And now you have gone through all that and you are all set to collect your data.Let me tell you that, this is one of the most important components of your research studybecause this is what is going to determine, what you get out of your data.So, today as we go through this lecture let me discuss about two main principles of dataquality, which is reliability and accuracy.So, reliability, what does it really mean?It means that your study should have repeatability and precision.What it means?If this same study is repeated by different investigators or the same measurement is doneb at different time points, you should still be able to get more or less similar results.It also refers to stability and consistency of the information.Now, reliability does not ensure that your data is accurate.Accuracy refers to ability of a measurement to be correct.It could happen that both the attributes may not happen at the same time or they may happen.So, let me give you an example of what would be the various scenarios in terms of dataquality.As you can see in the slide, your study might give you reliable and accurate result, whichmeans your data is giving the measurement that you really want, the measurement is accurateand repeatable.This is an ideal case scenario.The worst case scenario is that your measurement may not be reliable at all and may not beaccurate also.Now, there can be other scenarios, where your measurement is reliable, that is, if you repeatthis measurement again and again, you get the same measurement, same kind of resultrepeatedly.However, this could still not be accurate and there can be another scenario that youmay get the accurate result, but when somebody tries to repeat this experiment you may notbe able to repeat it at all.So, an ideal study should ensure that whatever outcome you are measuring is repeatable aswell as it is accurate, now to ensure that, we can follow certain principles of data collection.In todayâ€™s lecture, we will be going through six broad principles which are listed here.I will be walking you through each of these principles.So, the first is, as you have your questionnaire ready and you are all set to start your datacollection.One more step you need to do is, you need to develop a guide, guide wherein for eachof the questions you can have a small explanation as to how this data actually need to be collected.The second component that we will talk about is how you could do a good training of yourstaff members to ensure that the data quality is good.The third component is how do you ensure data quality, when the work has already been initiated.It could be in a clinic setting or it could be in the field and the next component ishow you need to do periodic reviews to ensure good quality of your data.During this process, it may happen that your staff will come across various difficultiesin data collection and you need to have periodic debriefing for that and finally and very,very important component is how you validate that your study results are actually correct.So, let us go over each of these components one by one.So, what do you really mean by a question by question guide?It is nothing but a short, simple document, which is a guide for your field worker oryour clinic research staff or whoever is involved in the data collection.Now, why this is an important component?Everybody may not understand the question in the same way.Different individuals or your staff members may have their own interpretations as to howthis questions need to be asked and how it need to be explained to the respondent.The q-by-q guide ensures that all the investigators uniformly ask the question and they all understandthe question in the same way.What you do here?You just take your questionnaire and write a short explanation under each of your question,as to how this question should be asked and what could be the possible responses and incertain situations you may have some probes.You would like the investigator to probe little more on a particular question.If you want them to do so, you would like to make a mention of that.Similarly, it allows you to explain, where they should skip?Where they should give more emphasis?All this guidance can be given through this small document.This not only provides a guide as to how data should be collected, but it is your road mapand at any point of time, whenever there is a doubt, whenever there is a lack of consistencywith in investigator you can always ask them to go back to this document to ensure thatthe data collection is being done in a uniform way.Now, it could happen that as you start collecting data, you may come across certain difficultiesin the field and you may have to revise this guide, which is all right and what is importantis whatever changes are done, they should be documented in this q-by-q guide at thatpoint of time.This is just to show you an example.For example, you have a question on, what is a type of house like we could give severaloptions, this is a kutcha house, it is semi pakka house or a pakka house.Everybody may not understand, what is a kutcha house?So, you may want to give an explanation.Observe the house and note, if it is made of mud or bricks and then you could writean explanation.If you find that the house is made of mud then mark it as a kutcha house.Similarly, another example when you are asking a question regarding household income?Now, it could happen that in a particular house hold there is more than one member,who are earning members of the family.And in this situation, you would like your investigators to first of all inquire, howmany earning members are there in the family?Then they need to find out each one of them, how much they earn?And what is their monthly income?They need to add up all, that amount and then write the answer as what is a total householdincome.So, similarly for each question you can have the detailed explanation.Now, once your q-by-q guide is ready, you are all set to start your data collection.Before you get on the ground, whether it is a clinic, whether it is a field base study,it is a household study, whatever will be the type of study, training, good trainingis essential to ensure that the quality of data is good and in that, the first and foremoststep is choosing right kind of people.You need to understand, what your study requirements are, and depending on the study requirements,you need to recruit or select right kind of investigators.Now, this could be depending on, suppose you are doing a study, which is on clinical research.Then you need to make sure that your investigators know how to ask the clinical questions.Are they knowing, how to use the clinical terms, when they are interacting with thepatient?If it is a field based study, you need to make sure that your investigators are familiarwith the local language.They know how to culturally interact with the people at the community level.So, selecting the right kind of investigator, who will be suitable for your data collection,is the most important step.Once you have done that, you need to have a classroom session with them.This is nothing, but walking them through your, first of all you introduce them to whatyour study is all about, why are you doing this study?What are your objectives?And what is that you would like them to know the basics of, what are the various definitionyou are using in the study?What are the various component of the study?What is the kind of data that needs to be collected?For example, your study may have different component, there could be a questionnaire,there could be different measurements and maybe you want them to measure something likeweight, height.So, you need to familiarize them, what are the various kinds of a data collection thatthey need to do?Once you have done that and given them the overview then you need to share this q-by-qguide, question by question guide.Walk them through each question, allow them to ask questions and let them go through itand see whether they are able to interpret those questions, whether they are able tounderstand those questions.Once, they have done that, you need to tell them what exactly they need to do in the field?How they need to ask those questions?And what should be the explanation that they should understand before they ask the questions?Now, as a first step having gone through this exercise, you would like them to probablydo this interviews, first of all in the classroom, wherein one of the investigator could actas the interviewer and the another investigator could be the respondent and they should simulatethis in front of you, which allows you to guide them, to tell them, how the questionneed to be asked.Whether the question is being understood by the respondent, whether question is beingasked in the appropriate language that is given in the questionnaire.Having done that you are all set to start your data collection, but there is one morestep.Now, having done something in the class room does not mean you will be able to do it onthe ground because the real situation may be very different.Some of your investigators may be working in that kind of a situation for the firsttime.For example, you may hire a person who is trained in clinical research, but they havenever been in a clinical setting.Similarly, you may hire a field investigator, who is a graduate in social work or any otherbackground.However, they may never have been in the community setting.So, once they get on to the ground, they may not feel the same level of comfort.So, before you get on to the main data collection, you need to have pilot.A pilot, where they do the interviews exactly in a similar setting, what your study settingis, but it may not be the same place, it may not be the same clinic or it may not be thesame village.In this situation you will see that, they may come up with different kind of questions.They may not have anticipated, how the respondent will respond.They may not have anticipated what difficulties might be there in making the respondent understandthe questions.So, as you through this pilot, you explain them the process, clarify their doubts andthis procedure you could continue unless everybody is very, very clear about what the questionsare and how the questions need to be asked.Now, having gone through this, you are all set now to do your final data collection.Here, what is very important is that, you need to plan your team structure.So, there has to be a supervisor, who could be present all the time or who could be presentperiodically along with the investigators.Ensure that the study forms are verified by supervisor every day.Now, why is this important because once you have left the clinic or once you have leftthe village or the place where you are doing data collection, some of the errors cannotbe corrected, during, as the data collection starts they may come up with different queries.So, you need to be available to answer those questions.This could be over the phone; this could be over messages or whatever way you can use.Now, once the data collection is ongoing, the next step that as a principle investigatoryou need to do is few on site visits, to ensure that the data collection is done as per theprotocol and the questionnaire is being actually used in the field the way you had perceivedit.I think one of the important thing you need to keep in mind is very often what happensis there are time pressures.You want to finish your study quickly, you want to be done with it, you may pressurizethem, you may say, I would like you to do ten questionnaire every day.However, you need to make sure that the quality is not diluted because you are pressing themto work under very tight time lines.Having done this, having your data collection, as data collection goes on at various timepoints you may want to review.Suppose, let us say you have already collected now, 50 forms.At this stage, you may want to make sure that the data collected is of good quality andthe data is complete.How can you do that?The first step can be done in the field itself.As your supervisor finishes the day, he can collect all the forms from various team membersand check them on that day itself.The next step is the forms will reach you as a principle investigator and you need togo through them to make sure that you are satisfied with the quality of data.Now, what kind of checks you can do, when you have got the forms in your hand?I think the first and foremost and the easiest one, but the most important one is ensurethere are no blanks.It could happen that when they are asking multiple question, since your questionnairemay have about 20 questions or 25 questions, they may just forgot to ask a few questionsor they may have asked the question, but they did not mark it in the questionnaire, butin either case you will see them as a blank.So, you need to ensure completeness of the data.The second is readability, sometimes the way it is marked it may be hard for you to evenunderstand and some of the answers could have some actual explanation to be written.Some kind of clinical symptoms or some kind of narratives have to be written, ensure thatthose things are readable.The next is the consistency, does the answers make sense?Do you feel that this could be the way the people would have answered or you got thisanswer because may be your respondents were not understanding the questions.Periodic reviews are essential, in case of any study, whether it is a clinical study;it is a field study or any type of research study.Now, these regular meetings, one it could be done by the supervisor, which could bein the field itself or after coming back or you, can have a periodic review once in aweek, once in a month, depending on what is duration of your study.What is that these review meetings will be useful for?First of all to clarify, if there are any queries they have about the questionnaires,if they understand the questions well, if they came across something which they hadnot anticipated.Now, it may happen that during these meetings you may end up doing some changes in the wayyour answers are drafted or in the way questions are asked.If you are doing that ensure, that these are well documented and they are added it in yourq-by-q guide.Now, coming to the last, but not the least very, very important component of data collection,which is validation of your data.How can this be done?So, for any study a small sub sample, it could be as small as even 5 percent should be selectedand an independent second interview should be done.This is to ensure that the data collected by your investigator is actually valid.By comparing the results, you will be able to find out, if there are any discrepancies,if somebody has made any major errors or if it could be that a particular investigatormight have been repeating certain errors or it may happen certain errors are repetitiveacross the team.So, depending on whatever the problem is you may want to discuss this with the individualteam member or with all the study team.So, just to sum up, what we have gone through today.Before you get on to your data collection, understand the concepts of data quality, goodtraining both in the classroom as well as on site, in a similar setting where you aregoing to conduct the study is essential for a good research study and supportive supervision,team work are key to good quality data collection.Thank you very much.

	- Hello friends.Welcome to this session, the course Health Research Fundamentals.We are in the last stages of our course.We have already covered important topics such as Importance of data collection, Importanceof validity, Importance of measurements and now I think we are in a position to understandthe Importance of the Principles of Data Management and Analysis.Today, we are going to cover 2 areas; one, database management; the other one, data analysisstrategy.Data management includes the following; Defining variables, creating a study database and datadictionary about which I am going to expand, entering the data and correct the errors,create a data set for data analysis, backing up the data and archiving the data set.Today, we are going to cover the key elements of data management, including Data structure,Data entry, Individual and aggregated databases, Mother and daughter databases.What is data structure?For some of you, who may be new to the word database.this is an example of a database, each of these lines, these horizontal lines representrecords, to one particular individual, each of these columns represent a variables, theinformation that is collected on certain variables based on the study question .We need to initially formulate the entire plan of how the data is going to be managed.That can come in the form of what is called data documentation.It can talk about the structure, meaning the name, number of records and other relevantinformation about the structure.The variables in terms of the name, what values that are assigned to the coding, etceteraand the history of this database in terms of when it was created?When it was modified?The storage related information, in which media it is going to be stored?Where and how it is going to be backed up?And any other relevant additional information is recorded in terms of the structure.Let us look at the first of the important elements in database, this is called Identifier.This identifier has to be unique, that is why it is called unique identifier.It is maintained by a computerized index and this particular unique identifier has to besecured by a quality assurance procedure that guarantees that each of this data has itsown internal validity.The code can comprise information that will talk about that particular individual.For example, it can have 7 digits; each of this digit or set of digits can refer to aspecific identifier information about that particular individual, about which, aboutwhom the data was collected, for example, in this example the first and the second digitcan denote the village or area, the next set of 2 digits the third and fourth may denotestreet, the digit number 5 may indicate the house or you know flat or residence, doornumber, the last 2 digits can denote the persons sequential number.Therefore, the 7 digit may represent about that particular individual and by parts itcan give information.You need to specify certain things about variables.The variable as you might have seen in the lecture on measurement, there are differenttypes of variables that do exist and therefore, it requires your attention in the beginningitself.You need to specify whether the variable will be entered as digits or if it is a numeric,whether the number of decimals are important, the variables can be entered as length, inwhich case you need to specify the length and it is preferable that when you are enteringas both text and number, you turn all the letters into capitals to avoid errors, whichcan cause a lot of problem in data analysis.And finally, you can have dates in specific format; when I say specific format you needto specify whether it is entered as the Indian format; date, month and year in 4 digits ormonth, month, date and then year; this has to be specified in the structure of the variable.While creating the variable names, which pertain to your data collection instruments aboutwhich you will have a clear idea later part of the course; you need to be very clear.The name, variable name should refer to an item in your data collection instrument.It has to be understandable format for example, if the questionnaire item is about exercisingwhether the individual exercises daily or not.The variable name could be EXERDAILY; exercise daily that clearly denotes what questionnaireitem it refers to.The second important criteria is in terms of keeping it short, leaving no space betweenthe letters of the variable name.Most softwares may require less than 10 characters therefore, you have to be very choosy at thesame time it is self explanatory.The third important aspect is, Be consistent for example, for different types of responseto a question on how frequently somebody exercises, exercising daily in the past can be denotedby EXERPAST, exercise past that clearly know self explanatory about the particular questionnaireitem.If it is currently daily then it is coded accordingly, if it is past occasionally thosewords are given in the variable names so that by looking at the variable name the investigatorcan easily identify; this is a variable, this is the questionnaire item it refers to.And finally, you may have variables collected as such these are called crude variables forexample, it may refer to number of times one exercises; it could be 3 times, 4 times, 5times a day.And finally, you may decide to regroup them into 2 categories; exercised or not, in whichcase you can denote that variable as exercise in the crude variable.As such, when the data was collected you can change into EXERCISE underscore 12, whichdenotes it is dichotomized.It is dichotomized into exercised or not.So, you have to be consistent in the pattern by which you create variable names.And finally, it is very important that you assign a variable name, otherwise if the softwareis left to assign a variable name by itself, it can create lot of confusion including duplicatesof similar items within the questionnaire.When you are designing a data collection instrument, about which my colleague is going to expandin the later part of this course; it is important that the design itself you are very clearabout broad sections of the questionnaire, so that when it is converted into databaseyou know that there are sections that you have to enter for example, there is a sectioncalled identifiers; there is a section called you know demographics, which means you knowone talks about age, gender, community and family related issues; and then the thirdsection called outcome.It is about the problem in the question and or disease if it is related to typically clinicalrelated information.And finally, another section called exposure in which you can talk about all the variablethat you are going to measure including, what Dr. Tarun might have already talked to youabout third factors including confounders.Finally, the instrument should allow an auto-coding, if you collect information on exercise daily;Yes - No; if it is written already written as 1 2, we need to enter into the database1 or 2, we do not have to code it again.So, that is what is meant by auto-coding.So, the data collection instruments should be designed in a way that it facilitates adata entry design easy.An important aspect of data entry is all about coding.It is always preferable to have numerical coding.Of course, you would have seen, if it is textual information in the form of qualitative thereis a different way of dealing with it but with reference to this section we are talkingabout quantitative data analysis.So, it is preferable to have numerical coding.In particular, you need to decide on how you will code missing values; it could be in theform of a dot or a depending on the field, you may choose to enter as 999, triple 9,be careful you do not enter you know a missing value for age is 99; that can mean differently.And, if it is not applicable you enter with a consistently with the particularly codingin the data collection instrument.For beginners, with inadequate experience in handling databases it is advisable do notcreate cumbersome codes.It is equally advisable for senior researches.For example, if you have a field do you walk everyday?Walking, as a variable.Do you cycle everyday?As another questionnaire; you have 2 variable names walking and cycling.Do you do both?And then there is a coding, and somebody very innovatively thought walking and cycling ifsomebody is engaged we will give a coding as 12, which is basically 1 and 2 combined,but that is not going to be helpful when you analyze information.And last, but very important this is very critical because most of the times you maybe dealing with dichotomized variables.So, you need to be very clear where you are going to give 1 for Yes, 0 for No or 1 forYes, 2 for No or 1 for present and 2 for absent, as a base line for all the gradients.Some of the softwares have a different understanding of this 1 and 0.So, when it comes to analysis you need to be careful about your software related detailsalso.Finally, when it comes to data entry you need to have what is called the catalogue.Before the data entry is made, you create what is called data dictionary or variablecatalogue in which you talk about each of these variables which questionnaire item itrefers to?What are the values there will be assigned to this variable?What is the meaning of the each of these values in a particular format?Some of the softwares generate on their own, this data dictionary as a variable catalogue,but then it is preferable that you develop your own data dictionary for your study, inwhich you refer first to the question item, the variable name that you have given, thetype of variable, the format in which data is collected, the values that are assignedto and some logical checks, if any.This is written so that if this database is shared with others, the person can make useof the data dictionary and can do the analysis on his or her own.It is equally important for you, if you after some time as lapsed you go back to the database,it gives an idea what you have done and what is it all about for each of this variablesand it helps you later when you want analyze your data again.Before data entry, one makes sure that there are checks and balances.This is also very important from ensuring internal validity.You specify minimum and maximum values that can enter into a particular field for example,if your study is about children up to 5 years, the age column will not entertain anythingmore than 5 years at the time of data entry itself.So, that it minimizes the errors that can come in even at the time of data entry, sothat these will be acceptable at the time of entry.You may specify skip patterns for example, if you ask a question do you exercise andthat person says, no; then you can skip a lot of questions about type of exercise, frequency,nature, intensity and things like that.So, skip patterns are very useful even at the time of data entry.And then of course, we talked about automatic coding, when you enter that code it automaticallydenotes something that is refered to in the data collection instrument and that can beanalyzed immediately.There may be certain times, need for copying data from the preceding record you know forexample, lab results if they have to be carried forward to another section it can get copiedby itself; this can be specified in the database.And finally, some calculations for example, you may collect height and weight data butyou may not calculate body mass index by your own in the data collection instrument.You can ask the database to do it when you enter height and weight it automatically calculatesBMI.So, these specifications are necessary before data entry is made.While you enter the data, it is important that we see these as an opportunity for cleaningthe database.For example, you enter a data and you find that there are some notes, you need to write,there are some clarifications that you need because you do not think that there is appropriate.So, it serves a purpose of cleaning, the data entry person refers this back to the investigatorfor additional inputs to clean up the data.You can use checks, while entering the data which we also discussed as an automated checkwithin the database.You have to mark each paper as and when the data entry is completed so that the duplicatesare not entered and after the data is entered you may have to validate by different means.So therefore, data entry is one step in the data cleaning aspect.We talked about individual and aggregated databases.We showed you a database that is an individual database, each record in the horizontal lineis an observation.There could be instances in which you may have aggregated databases, where you may entercounts in each of the records.If you enter only one count by record that it is ideal, that is called normalize databasebecause normalize database in which each of the rows contain only one count for that particularrecord.It facilitates aggregation by a , I will show you what it is.For example, on the left hand side you see an example of individual data about peoplein whom place, age, gender and onset.So, each of these records indicate an individual and at the same time, we can have aggregateddata for example, by place one can also get number of people affected, number of peoplehaving problem and things like that.So, this is an aggregated data by place, whereas the red color database shows the individualdata.There can be an instance in which you may have what is called, Mother and daughter database.You may collect information at various levels; you may collect information at the villagelevel, you may collect the information at the household level, you may collect informationat the individual in the household, you may collect within an individual information aboutseveral episodes of illness or different problems in that individual using different questionnaire.So, in essence you may have information about different levels, that does not mean you knowyou repeat the information in all the levels for that particular individual, for example,for that individual you will write information about the house; for that individual you writeinformation about the village, not necessary you can keep them at their level.And then, at the time of data analysis you can link the database that comes from villagewith database that comes from household, you can link the database that comes from householdto the individuals so that you can sensibly analyze, you do not have to worry about keepingeverything together and get confused at the time of data analysis.For example, this is a household level data where you have information about the houseID, location, the house has such its community status and its income.The individual in the house may have information pertaining to whether they have a diseaseor not or they are exposed to particular factor or not.So, you can see here the house ID is repeated here, the person ID for that particular firsthousehold is indicated here and diseased or not or exposed or not are here.These are 2 different databases entered differently; one is a household database, another is anindividual house database.We can link them as and when necessary using this connection called house ID, which iscommon to both the databases.There is a procedure by which we can do these in softwares, you can even merge this filesif needed.Summing up on the data management, you need to code database numerically, you need toenter data using quality assurance procedure which I outlined, need to store informationat the level, where it needs to be stored and we can relate or merge files when neededand as required.Thank you very much.

	- Hello friends, welcome to this session, the course Health Research Fundamentals.I am going to look at Data Analysis.What are the key objectives of data analysis?The objectives are, to plan an analysis, program analysis; deal with chance, biases and thirdfactors, to assess causality that is what Dr. Sanjay Mehendale talked in the first session.The essence of research is to link an exposure to an outcome and finally, to measure theimpact it has in clinical or in domain of science.The data analysis strategy has its sequence and I am going to talk about these 7 steps.The first step is identifying the study type, which is essential before you venture intodata analysis.The second is in terms of identifying main variables.The third, becoming familiar with the data.Fourth, characterize the study population and fifth, examining the association betweenexposure and outcome based on the study type and sixth, in terms of a creating additionaltables and finally, to conduct an advance analysis.. Identifying a study type is the first andforemost step before you enter into data analysis, because it establishes the main frame work.I am going to repeat again that you need to know whether you are dealing with the descriptivequestion or descriptive study or you are dealing with an analytical study.If a descriptive study is involved, you need to measure a quantity and estimate appropriateindicator, which I am sure you have seen in the measurements lecture and if it is an analyticalstudy, you need to test a hypothesis using statistical text.For that clarity, you need to be familiar with the study, you need to look at the protocolespecially for study objectives and study type, you need to review the entire questionnaire,you need to look at the analysis plan, you need to look at the data collection procedures,you need to obtain the electronic data base and you may have to decide on software foranalysis about which we will see at the end.. This analysis depends on the statement ofobjectives and study type.Therefore, the nature of research question has to be very clear, whether it is descriptiveinvolving, describing one group measuring a quantity or is this analytical involvingsome intervention comparing two groups and hypothesis..If it is descriptive, you need to ask this question whether it is acute or chronic outcomeand then accordingly, you will zoom into a study design and then measure either incidenceor prevalence..If it is analytical and again you will ask question what is the study outcome?You may decide on acute or chronic outcome and then choose an appropriate measure ofindicator, it could be relative risk or risk ratio, if a cohort study or it is odds ratiobased on case-control study or prevalence ratio or prevalence odds ratio.. So therefore, your analysis plan depends onyour review of the study with reference to; what is the main frame work?What is the research question that they are trying to answer?. The second thing you need to identify themain variables.What are the outcomes?What are exposures?What are the potential third factors?And what is the variables that be need to consider for subgroup analysis?We need to be familiar, intimate with the data.How do you do that?You need to perform a frequency distribution of all the variables.Look at the frequency of all the variables in your data set and then you look at descriptivestatistics which helps you to describe the study population.This will give you a fairly good idea of what this data set is all about.And secondly, you review the observations by its status in the database, are they duplicates,cross check, looks for missing observations, check the ranges and legal values againstthe specified in the data dictionary, check for consistency in the pattern of the data.So this is the crucial step, the third step which you need to spend a sufficient time..Fourth, you need to characterize the study population with reference to the basic characteristicsof the study population.These could be in terms of you know socio-demographic and economic variables by age, gender, whatincome groups and things like that.And then if it involves analytical study you look at in the two groups or three groups,the comparison groups these variables.You may want look at frequency of clinical features as well in characterizing study population.. Fifth, is in terms of examining the outcomeand exposure association, this is the most interesting part.This is based on a priori hypotheses or hypothesis, where you compare the groups for frequencyof exposures using appropriate measure of association which we talked about earlier.This has to be based on prior knowledge; it has to be based on study design because asyou of seen earlier, each of the study design has its own measurement of association forthe specific exposure and outcome.Therefore, this is a very critical step.And then you may also apply the principles that you know you might have learnt from Dr.Tarun, when he talked about the biases and confounding that can complicate this associationapart from the biological and knowledge that we have about particular exposure and outcome.. The sixth step is in terms of creating additionaltwo-way table for analyzing new variables that you may detect on the basis of findingsthat have already generated.. The seventh step could be in terms of a dose-response,stratifications and multivariate modeling analysis.. Therefore, these are the steps that you willconclude by analyzing the data for generating information that you think will be usefulto improve the health of the study population.Some practical tips that you may want to keep in your notes in terms of a prior plan ofanalysis.It is very useful, it is has to be done.The data analysis has to be done; plan has to be prepared well in advance.We will recommend you to use empty tables to prepare analysis.In your reading material you will see such empty tables for each of the study designs.We have prepared an empty table shell, so for your study you can prepare a plan of actionfor analysis, this is how my table will look like and then at the time of analysis yourattempt is to fill up that empty shells.The second step is in terms of analyzing by stages go by stages.You first do the recoding that is necessary, you may create new variables, you may dichotomize,you may look at the descriptive information, you may decide to change the way you cut thetwo groups, you may decide on three or four groups for measuring those response basedon your understanding from the data, you may do the next step of descriptive analysis andthen finally, analytical analysis.So this has to be a sequential process, it should not jump.People have the tendency to jump the steps; I think it has to be in the measured mannerone by one.And finally, please avoid any analysis that is driven by the data that you analyze withoutany plan, this is called Post Hoc analysis.You did not have a plan, you finally find something and then you tried to make newsout of it.Last but very important, you do not look squeeze of the data because you want something.As an example, we talked about exercise and diabetics you remember.In the initial stages of the analysis, if this question has to be answered through dataanalysis, we will recode the data, we will recode in terms of creating an outcome data.Here, we talked about blood sugar levels so we have to group the outcome into positiveoutcome, yes, reduce blood sugar level, negative outcome, no, not reduced, blood sugar is notreduced, so that is the outcome.Then we may recode some key variables such as, age-groups can be cutoff, income levelcan be used to cutoff as you know ok income, not so ok income, or below poverty line orabove poverty line and things like that.This recoding we may do for number of variables including for examples, in terms of exercise,moderate, heavy, mild or no exercise, we can create groups during this recoding stage.And then in the descriptive stage we calculate the frequency of the outcome by each of thesegroups.. Analytical stage, we do it in three steps.One is Univariate analysis, where we look at one upon the other.We look at the outcome which is in terms of reduction of blood sugar level by age, genderor income or such similar variables that are collected in the data base.Then, if you want to do a stratified analysis or dose response effect you can examine theoutcome by categories of a particular variable.For example, if there are income categories quartiles or levels of income, low incomegroup, middle income group, high income group, what is the frequency of outcome?You can examine.And then you may do a stratified analysis, for example if you want to look at the exposurethat is exercise and its relationship with reduction in blood sugar level among incomegroups stratified by age, gender and income.You can look at all of this in the next step.And finally, a model, logistic regression model would tell us whether exercise can predictreduction in fasting blood sugar level in the diabetes.Finally, for beginners or people who have no exposure handling databases, you may wonderwhat data base to use.The usual trap that we get into is using spreadsheets for data management and analysis of any typein size.We think that it is a small data, let use it in we know as spreadsheet but I think,we recommend that you better avoid that temptation because spreadsheet are not meant to be datamanagement or data analysis tools.It is preferable to use softwares that can give you both the capabilities data managementand as well as data analysis.For example, we are just suggesting that this is one of the softwares that we find wherewe using free software call Epilnfo, which has the capability to for example, createa data collection instrument format, enter the data, analyze using the even you knowfor some the latest visual analysis and then it has the capability to map the informationif that is part of your analysis.And finally, it can also be used for a fairly a good amount of statistical analysis.So, such softwares may be very helpful.We wish you good luck with your database a management as well as data analysis becausethat leads to report generation.Thank you very much.
