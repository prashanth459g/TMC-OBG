	- All of you by now, have gone through the basics of research in terms of conceptualizing theideas, study designs, ethical and scientific contact of research.I am sure now you are ready, to give life to your research ideas in the form of conceptpaper.I am going to introduce to you, how to prepare a concept paper for research projects.At the end of this session, you will be in a position to write a concept paper for researchproject.Now, let us revisit the seven steps of a successful protocol.These are logical, sequential and essential steps.The steps include, identifying research topic, framing research question and objectives andthen moving on to outlining a one-page concept paper, preparing dummy tables as per the analysisplan, writing a detailed drafted protocol, preparing instruments and annexes includinginformation sheet, consent form and other things related to the study protocol; submitthis to your competent peer review committee and finally, seek review by an ethics committee.Let us look at the life cycle of research and how the steps are important in relationto the life cycle of research.We will see that, we started with identifying data needs and we end with requiring moreinformation that necessitates for the research.So, therefore, in the concept paper has to capture all of these elements in a miniatureform of a protocol.We are today in the second step, how do we outline a one-page concept paper?You may wonder, why one-page and there is a reason for it.The time, for everybody is very precious for you, for your faculty, for your guides, foryour reviewersâ€™, time is precious.Equally, the funding agencies are also hot pressed for time.So, a one-page in a shorter version forces you to be focused.Many of our ideas just are not born, they remain as ideas.One page, to write a one page as compared to a long detailed protocol, may help us inovercoming the inhibition that we have in writing the detail protocol.Therefore, the ideas may be born rather than getting aborted, that is the reason for one-page.I am going to now outline this one-page, what it requires in bullet styles in each of thesections of the concept paper.It has these sections, which is essentially, as I said earlier, miniature of the protocol.It has section on background and justification, statement of objectives as a separate section,method section, expected benefits, key references and budget.I am going to elaborate on each of this section.Let us begin with looking at background and justification.The background and justification essentially will have 3 bullets.One on the importance of the study problem, second what is known and unknown about theproblem in relation to the literature and in relation to the local context, lastly theinformation that is needed to address the problem effectively.Now, let us look at the statement of objectives.In the concept paper, we want you to state not more than 2 or 3 objectives.If needed you may have to split them as general and specific.As we have discussed, in the earlier session on research questions and objectives, youneed to indicate which is your primary objective and which are your secondary objectives.This is very critical because the objectives give clarity to the reviewers about your researchprocess.The next section is on methods.It has to give by bullets an outline of all the aspects of methods covering, for example,study design, study population, key operational definitions, the sampling methodology by whichyou will select your study participants, the calculation of sample size and key considerationsfor sample size.The data collection procedures, who will collect?What will they collect?And an analysis plan around the key objectives.Finally, this section will end up by saying, what are the ethical issues and which ethicscommittee will review this protocol, if developed.And next section is on expected benefits.As you have listened from the earlier session, the research question is to be answered.There are two aspects of benefits that we look forward in answering the research question.One, what action will be taken following the results?Second, what is a future research or planning or policy agenda as a result of this finding?This is very important from the concept paper point of view, you have to set out this inthis section and finally, you need to show that you have mastered the literature.These key references may be referred to in the introduction section and may be neededto refer to some operational definitions in the method section, citation of a reference.We suggest that you need not put in more than 5 references.However, we recommend strongly, you follow internationally acceptable standard guidelinesfor writing these references.We recommend, you to adopt and use International Committee of Medical Journal Editors guidelines,which is accepted globally by many bio medical journals.The last section is on budget.You may wonder, why budget is important in this concept paper, but it is equally importantto technical and other aspects of preparing a concept paper.This is an indicative budget; it need not have detailed justification.It can cover key items like salaries/per diem, travel, equipments and supplies and miscellaneous,whatever is applicable to the conduct of the research that you are proposing.Many research agencies insist on having an indicative budget.So, this is also equally important.Let us look at some of the aspects of application of this concept.If you look at Indian Council of Medical Research, the premier medical research agency in thecountry, ICMR on its home page offers funding for researchers, like you and me.There is a provision called extramural funding on its home page and you will see on the homepage there is a provision to submit, what they call as pre-proposal format, this issimilar to concept paper.This pre-proposal format covers the following, a title, an introduction, a novelty, applicabilityand description of the project.You will see that they have specified word count for each of the section.Now, if you see the outline that be provided, most of this can be taken from the conceptpaper that we just now, generic concept paper that we just now provided you, except maybe, novelty you may have to write it as, in a fresh section.The ICMR is also promoting research culture among medical undergraduates.They are offering, what is called Short-term studentship for medical undergraduates inIndia, they call it STS proposals.The format for STS proposal, the preliminary one goes like this.It has a title, introduction, objectives, methodology, implications and references.This looks exactly similar to the generic format that we just now recommended.The implication is something similar to the expected benefits that we just now discussed.So, what we are recommending is that, many Indian, other Indian and international agenciesaccept this pre-proposal or concept note or concept paper as a first step before awardingfunding to the researchers.This first step helps them in screening the proposal for its worthiness, merit to awardthe funds.In fact, some of the research funding agencies even fund and support developing a conceptpaper, if it is meritorious to a full pledged protocol through their own funding.So, ready, handy concept paper is very useful to submit to such research funding opportunities.Therefore, what can you achieve with one-page concept paper?It helps you to organize your ideas, find just right words in a brief, but succinctmanner that helps you to stand out in the competition; you may receive rapid and positiveresponse.For your benefit in the reading section, you will find a template concept paper, one pager,a word document which you may use for writing your concept paper.Second, we have also provided a sample concept paper.Now, here we look at two templates of concept papers, one for writing observational studiesanother for interventional studies.I am going to show them and go through the parts of these two templates.The first one is on observational studies, as you can see you can type your title ofthe project, you can type your name, the first section is about background and justificationand we have provided tips.You can actually, overwrite on these 3 bullets; the first bullet is about the contexts ofthe study problem in a quantified manner with linked references.The second bullet is about the local contexts, which what we know and what we do not knowis stated.The third bullet, in terms of what information we need to manage the problem effectively,you can just overwrite on these 3 bullets.The next section is about statement of objectives.We have some tips here, you need to state them quanitatively for the primary objectiveand you may make it clear, whether you want to propose to estimate a quantity or testhypothesis depending on the nature of the research question and statement of the objectives,which we discussed earlier.And last, but very important, you need to clearly distinguish the secondary objectivesfrom the primary objectives.The next section is an elaborate section on methods.As we discussed, it should be in bullets and you can derive from tips for the type of studydesign from this widely accepted guidelines available in this website, equator-network.orgYoucan state the study population; you can state the study design in one bullet.It could be in terms of observational study design, it could be a survey, it could becase control cohort studies or ecological studies or sometimes, it could be you know,even case report or case series depending on the study design that you choose, basedon the objectives.Then the operational definitions, you need to provide key definitions only and here iswhere, as I discussed earlier, you can make a reference to the standard definition forthe literature criteria.You can even state control recruitment strategy for the case control study.Sampling procedure, you can state in one bullet, sample size you can briefly mention the samplesize and the assumptions.Data collection you need, as I said, you need to spell out, who will collect the data?What kind of data they will collect and within what time frame?And briefly, the quality assurance that is going to be used, finally, the analysis plan,we need to summarize the type of analysis based on the primary and secondary objectives.You may mention laboratory analysis, if they are part your study.Human subject production, you may have to mention about key measures that are takento ensure the protection of the human participants and which ethics committee will review thisproposal and last, but important section is on expected benefits.You need to describe the report that will be generated and the outcome of the studyin order to manage the problem, study problem effectively in the area where the studiesconducted.The references, the 5 references, you can even make it small font size, but adhere tothe standard guidelines, which we recommend that you use ICMJE guidelines.Finally, in the budget section, in a brief or 4 bullets.So, this is on observational studies.So, we will now look at concept paper for intervention studies.For intervention studies, the background has to state, what is known and unknown for thedrug or interventions or management of the specific study problem that you are talkingabout and you need to say why the information currently available is insufficient.You need to state the objectives clearly here in terms of primary objective, which willlook at the primary outcome.In terms of methods, you may benefit from using the guidelines that are available forwriting a clinical trial protocol.So, you may use the elements from that guideline, which is called SPIRIT.The method section is pretty much similar except that you need to state in the clinicaltrial concept paper, specifically interventions, the drug or interventions with dosage, frequency,nature and all the other forms of interventions.Operational definitions, you may have to state the primary and secondary outcomes.You may have to state the participant recruitment strategy.The next important section is on randomization sequence allocation and allocation concealment.You have to briefly mention the type of randomization, methods used to generate and implement theallocation, and masking has to mention as to the level and type of masking.The other sections are pretty much similar to what we saw in the concept paper templatefor observational studies.We have a sample out there in the reading section; please makes make use of it whilewriting your concept papers.We hope you will benefit by making use of it and make writing concept paper a habitand we wish you give birth to your ideas.Wish you all the best.Thank you.

	- Today, we are going to talk about the Elements of a Protocol that you would write for a ResearchStudy.Remember, that we are in the last week of the online course and you have gone throughall the aspects of how to start designing a research study, starting from thinking abouta research question, doing sampling, selecting the research participants, doing measurementsfor exposures and outcomes, looking after the human subject protection and so forth.Now, these are all the structures of a research project and when all these structures fora research project come together in a written format and that is what is known as a protocol,which is basically a written plan for a study.Now, in the last session of writing a concept paper if you remember, Dr. Manickam talkedyou through the 7 steps of writing a successful protocol, beginning from identifying yourresearch topic and the study objectives, outlining a one-page concept paper, preparing dummytables and that is when you get on to the part of writing your protocol.We usually start off with writing a draft protocol and then it is refined adding variouselements to it and ultimately ending up with seeking ethics committee approval before youare able to actually do the study.Remember that, when you first start out writing the protocol, you are basically writing itas you are thinking about it and if you already made a concept paper, you are in a good positionbecause you can then just use the concept paper as an outline to actually write in moredetail about various aspects that you have already mentioned as bullet points in yourconcept paper and develop it into a protocol.Usually, the objectives section of your protocol, you would take it as you have stated out alreadyin your concept paper, but the other elements like background and justification, the methods,the expected benefits, these are some of the sections that you would have to now give moreelaborate details in your research protocol.It is also generally a norm that usually the first draft should not to be too long, generallyabout 1500 to about may be 2000 words with a small introduction, less than one- fifthof the total protocol, which will keep you focused.And of course, remember that, you would given a few references in your concept paper andnow you can increase a references, depending on how much detail you are adding to yourprotocol and so you have may be 5 or 10 or even more key references as is needed foryour protocol.So, as I said, we need much more details and the major part of the protocol would actuallybe your methods section, wherein you give the whole detailed plan of how you are goingto conduct the study, starting from the study design, describing the interventions, if youare doing an experimental study, describing a study population, writing out your operationaldefinitions, what was the sampling method that you used, how did you calculate the samplesize, what would be the data collection methods, what would be the tools to do that?What is your analysis plan?And then, a detailed project implementation plan to maintain the quality and finally,the last section on human subject protection.We will walk through each one of these steps, little bit more in detail to see, how youcan develop your protocol.So, in terms of the first paragraph would be the paragraph on study designs.Now, this is where you explain, how the objectives that you have stated at the end of the introductionsection, how they would be measured?How would you frame indicators?And what design would be used in your study to fulfill these objectives?Remember, your study design could be experimental or observational; in term it could be a cohortstudy, a case control or cross sectional study, again, depending on what your study objectiveis.You need to define again, a little bit more in detail in the protocol, whether your studywould follow a prospective design or a retrospective design, in terms of how you are going to collectdata and how your study is designed..In the next paragraph, you would now want to describe the interventions, assuming that,if you are doing an experimental study, whether it is a clinical trial or a community basedintervention.Accordingly, you will describe your intervention, who is going to be intervened, What exactlyis your intervention, give it in more detail.What would be the time period over which this intervention is going to be applied to yourintervention group and how would, that be done?So, the whole procedure of whether, you are doing a clinical intervention or a communitybased intervention has to be described in detail in this paragraph, if you are doingan experimental study.The next paragraph would be detailing about your study population.What is the inclusion and the exclusion criteria that you are going to be using to select thepopulation either, which may be hospital based, community based or population based into yourstudy.You would use over what time period you are going to select this people.What would be, say, the geographical location from where you are going to select this people?And what would be the individual characteristics of the people that you going to select intoyour study or keep them out of the study, which would be written in the form of an exclusioncriteria.Remember that, study population is different from the actual study sample that you aregoing to take from this population, or the study population is general population amongwhich you are going to be doing the study and a part of them, you are going to be samplingbased on your sample size and sampling strategy into your study.Next paragraph gives the details on the various operational definitions that you are goingto be using in your study.You spell out, how you are going to define and measure your key outcome measures.What would be your key exposure measures?And again, what would be the operational definitions of these measures?Remember that, you need to be very clear and specific in terms of these definitions.And many a times, there may be standard definitions, standard ways and means of measuring the outcomesor measuring certain exposures and then it is always good to use these standard definitionsand again for which you would need to provide references, if you are using any of the standardmethodologies to define your variables that you are going to be using in the study.The next paragraph is about sampling.You need to give in detail, what type of sampling you are going to be using, whether it is arandom sample or a non random sample, using systematic sampling, simple random sampling,cluster sampling, multi-stage sampling or whatever the case may be, as is applicableto your study and how are you going to select this sample in actual practice.So, all the steps in doing this sampling have to be detailed out in this section of yourprotocol.Again, if you are using standard methods of sampling, it is also a good idea to providereferences of the standard ways in which this has already been applied in other settings.If you are doing randomized clinical trials then you would be using randomization andas was discussed earlier there are several ways of doing randomization.So, this would be the paragraph, where you would explain which kind of randomizationtechnique you are going to be using and how are the study subjects going to be randomizedinto your control group and your intervention group.Of course, what follows is the paragraph on sample size, where you will explain how youhave calculated the sample size.What are all the parameters that you have used to estimate the sample size?Remember that, the sample size will depend on their study objective as well as the samplingmethodology that you are going to employ for your study.You further need to give in detail, how this estimate is generated, what formulas wereused, whether you will be using any softwares for doing that?And again, you need to provide references for these things.Following the sample size is the paragraph on data collection.There would be 2 sections to this paragraph: one part is where, what is all the kind ofdata that you are going to collect?Whether it is socio demographic characteristics, the individual characteristics of the studyparticipants, their clinical histories, the science and symptoms and so forth.Secondly, you would also need to specify, how you are going to collect this data.Who is going to do that?What data is going to be collected by the principle investigator or is it going to besome other study investigators, who are going to collect it?Is it going to be a staff nurse?Is it going to be an outreach worker and so forth.And of course, how you are going to collect this data.What study instrument are you going to be using to collect this in data?Are you going to be doing interviews?Are they going to be face to face?Is it going to be computer based?Are you going to extract data using data abstraction forms?Or if you are doing qualitative methods, would you be doing focus group discussions or in-depthinterviews?And what would be the guides for collecting this kind of data?Once, you have spelled out your data collection methods the next paragraph will be explaining,how you are going to analyze this data.Once you have collected the data what would be your mode of data entry?Is it going to be manual?Is it going to be computer based?What software are you going to be using to analyze this data?You also need to give in detail various stages that you may go through in doing the dataanalysis, if you are going to be recoding certain variables that you are going to collectduring your data collection.What are you going to estimate?What parameters?Whether it is prevalence, incidence or if you are doing analytical studies, what kindof analysis are you going to go through and the various steps that you are going to gothrough that.So, all of this has to be mentioned in this analysis plan paragraph.It is not just enough to say that suitable analysis will be carried out for this study.That seems quite vague and it is not a good idea.It does not give a good impression; it shows that maybe you are not planned your studywell enough.So, it is always a good idea to actually lay out what all analysis you are going to becarrying out to fulfill your study objectives.The next paragraph is quite important and it is actually quite a lengthy part of yourprotocol and which is basically, detailing the steps that you are going to use to actuallyimplement the study to ensure data quality at all stages of the study, in the way youare going to collect the data, in the way you are going to do data entry and analysis,how you going to report these study results.This is also the place, we are going to give in detail the various roles and responsibilitiesthat the investigators in the study have.It is also good place to provide, what would be the project governance?Who would be responsible for this project, both in terms of administrative responsibilitiesas well as the technical responsibilities?Who is the PI, the primary investigator?Who are the co-investigators?What their roles are and how various project activities are going to be coordinated?Basically, all the logistics of actually implementing the data collection phase in the field andof course, you need to also provide, what is going to be the timeline for your study?What is going to be your study period?How are different phases of your study starting from say, designing the instruments, gettingapprovals from ethics committees, then doing pilot testing and then actual collection ofdata followed by data entry, analysis and so forth?So, you need to give a timeline over the period of your study or for various activities thatyou are going to be doing as part of implementing your study.The last paragraph in the methods section is the paragraph on human subjects protectionand this is where you explain in detail, how you are going to make sure that your studyparticipants are protected from any harm and here, this would usually have sub-headingsin terms of what are the potential risks that you foresee your participants may be goingthrough, when you are collecting data?What are the procedures that you are going to use to minimize these risks?How you going to maximize the benefits?Are you going to give them any compensation?Again, this is the place, where you give in detail of what kind of informed consent areyou going to take from the study participants.Is it going to be a written consent, oral consent?Who is going to take the consent?How long will it take?What would be the various elements of this consent?And then what would be the various procedures that you would need to get approval for yourstudy from the ethics committee of your institution.Now, once you have put together all these elements in the protocol, you also need toappend to it, all your data collection instruments depending on your study design, your studyobjectives and so forth you would have decided what data collection instruments you are goingto be using, whether these are questionnaires or abstraction forms, a structured observationguide or if you using qualitative methods and either an in-depth interview guide ora focus group discussion guide, whatever be it.This is the place where you are going to append all of these instruments to your protocoland it is always a good idea to have these instruments in local languages as well becausethat is how in the field you are going to be collecting data.So, you would have both the data collection instrument in English as well as in the locallanguage.And then at the end, what you need to do is to put annexures, which gives in more detailvarious different components of actual study implementation.These could include things like forms, which state the various standard operating proceduresof how you are going to be collecting information, whether this is field based or laboratorybased or clinic based and so forth.You may want to provide, how are you going to train your field workers or train yourstudy investigators in collecting data.What would be the training module and the framework for the same?If you have participant recruitment material, that is something that gets appended intothe annexes.Other forms, such as adverse event management forms, study management forms, again wouldform a part of your annexures and most importantly would be your consent forms, the participantinformation sheet as well as the consent statement form, wherein the study participant, who wouldbe signing off for agreeing to participate in the study.Again, remember that wherever participants are involved and wherever you have forms thatinvolve participants, you may need to have forms both in English as well as in the locallanguage.And of course, once you have put this altogether, you need to firm it up.Remember that, writing a protocol is usually not a one step process.It goes through several drafts and it is always a good idea to actually get it reviewed throughyour peers, who could be your colleagues or even subject matter experts and get feedbackfrom them and then revise and revise your protocol to get to a final stage, where itcan be submitted for review to the ethics committee.Now, the ethics committee may themselves have certain suggestions or they may want somethings to be changed or revised in your protocol.So, you will have to be doing that and so again, this will lead to another draft ofyour protocol.By the time you are ready with the final draft, you would actually have a multiple draftsand it is always a good idea to archive all these drafts so that you know how your studyis evolved and what are the different ways in which you have planned you study.Now, as a resource material, I would like you to take a look at this website, whichis called equator hyphen network dot org.And this is a website, which would be very useful for you to develop study protocols.It has a lot of links and a lot of resource material.One of the important one, which is right there on itâ€™s home page is what they called thereporting guidelines for main study types and if you look, you have guidelines for observationalstudies, for experiments, for clinical trials, for qualitative research diagnostic studiesand so forth.And you even have one section on study protocols, so there is the SPIRIT protocol; the SPIRITguidelines, which basically gives you guidelines on how to write a protocol for clinical trialsin particular.And then, the other reporting guidelines, whether it is the CONSORT statement or theSTROBE for the observation studies, PRISMA for looking at meta analysis and the systematicreviews, although these are called reporting guidelines, but you could actually use thesetemplates to even make your protocols because ultimately, what you are going to report isgoing to based on how you have written your protocol.So, remember that, we have come to actually the last week of this course and you wouldhave seen this life cycle in the week one and we have been following this life cycleof research, which takes you through various steps in which you would do a research studyand please keep this in mind that following this life cycle is vital to have a study thatis logical, that is focused and that is efficient in the way that you are going to conduct thestudy.So, whenever you are thinking of writing a study protocol, designing a study, make sureyou do not jump across the steps of this life cycle and you follow the step one after theother and I ensure you that you are going to end up, with a very good protocol for yourstudy design.
### Publication ethics
- Learning objectives, At the end of the session, the participants will be able to-
	 1. Recognize various ethical issues related to publication
	 2. Make use of the guidelines available from various national and international organizations for publication ethics
- Recap: Life cycle of a research
	- ![[Pasted image 20220321215243.png]]
- Why to publish a research finding?
	- Promotes academic/ career progression (Medical Council of India, 2017)
	- Allows us to communicate research findings
	- Increases responsibility to influence practice
	- Identifies research gaps, potential areas of future research
- Postgraduate biomedical research in India setbacks are
    - Lack of relevance of research question
    - Not addressing the local needs
    - Inappropriate design and methods
    - Inaccessibility of the full report
		- IndiaCLEN 2013 Annual Conference Group (ACG) et al. IndiaCLEN recommendations for improving postgraduate medical research and publication. Clinical epidemiology and global health 2013:53-84
	- There are examples of Postgraduate research contributing to clinical practice

- Components of Publication Ethics
	 1. Ethics review/ Breach of confidentiality
	 2. Fabrication and Falsification
	 3. Authorship
	 4. Plagiarism
	 5. Ethics related to submission
	 6. Conflict of interest
1. **Ethics review**/ Breach of confidentiality
	- *Trials*- Registration with "Clinical Trial Registry of India" (CTRI)
	- Informed *consent* / assent - A must when you are conducting research with human participants
	- Data *confidentiality* - Without institutional permission, you can not share your data with someone for analysis who is working in a different institution

	- National Ethical Guidelines for Biomedical and Health Research involving human participants, ICMR, 2017
	- Human / animal ethics committee approval as per National guidelines
2. **Fabrication**/ Falsification
    - If the research results not generated from the study (falsification) or generated by manipulating data (fabrication)
	    - Extremely serious misconduct
	    - All the case report forms and the data should be preserved
	- Example of falsification and fabrication 
		- A final year postgraduate student came to me requesting to analyze his thesis data. He also asked if I could make some significant results, though they weren't initially so! -->==Falsification==
		- Curiously I asked how he has collected the data. To my surprise, he revealed that the data was taken from his senior's thesis.  --> ==Fabrication==
	- Example 2 
		- ![[Pasted image 20220321215857.png]]
		- Breech of trust of the common people/ loss of time and the resources
3. **Authorship**
    - Authorship confers credit, implies responsibility and accountability of the published work
    - Each author should be clear about their responsibility
    - It is mandatory to declare the contribution of each author
    - Decide on authorship while writing protocol
    - The ICMJE (International Committee of Medical Journal Editors) recommends that authorship be based on 4 criteria :-
		 1. Substantial contributions to the conception or design of the work; or the acquisition, analysis, or interpretation of data for the work; AND
		 2. Drafting the work or revising it critically for important intellectual content; AND
		 3. Final approval of the version to be published; AND
		 4. *Agreement to be accountable* for all aspects of the work in ensuring that questions related to the accuracy or integrity of any part of the work are appropriately investigated and resolved
4. Ethics related to submission
    - Simultaneous submission- submitting the same manuscript simultaneously at the different journals
    - Duplicate publication- Submitting a new manuscript with same hypothesis, methods, data, discussion and conclusion
    - Self-citation- citing own publication out of context
    - Predatory journals- Hardly peer reviews any manuscript
		- List of predatory journals- University Grants Commission- Consortium for Academic and Research Ethics (UGC-CARE)
5. Plagiarism
    - Use of previously published manuscript by someone for his/ her manuscript or unreferenced use of other's published and unpublished ideas without consent, credit, or acknowledgement
    - Most common form of plagiarism is copying text word-for-word
    - Considered as serious publication misconduct
	- **Types** of Plagiarism
	    - *Direct* Plagiarism 
		    - Complete or partial copying without acknowledging the original author
	    - *Self-Plagiarism* 
		    - Duplicates of previous works or sentences
	    - *Redundant publications* ('salami' publications) 
		    - Publishing similar manuscripts/reports based on the same experiments
	- *How to avoid* plagiarism?
	    - Avoid 'copy-paste'
	    - Write the concept in own words- spend more time
	    - Acknowledge original sources (Even unpublished works)
	    - Cite references accurately
	    - Avoid writing several articles of the same type
	    - Use anti-plagiarism software tools like '[URKUND](https://www.ouriginal.com/)', '[Ithenticate](https://www.ithenticate.com/)' or '[Turnitin](https://www.turnitin.com/)' etc. (as per University norms)
6. *Conflict of interest* (COI)
    - Financial, personal, social or other interests that directly or indirectly influence the conduct of the author with respect to the manuscript
    - Example- A PG/ researcher is conducting a drug trial which is funded by a pharmaceutical company.
    - Disclose any such conflicts during submission (Mandatory)
    - Readers can determine the influence of such COI on conclusion of the paper
- Consequences of research misconduct
	- COPE (Committee on Publication Ethics) describes the consequences:
	    -  Depends on the type of misconduct (Major/ Minor)
	    -  Author can get blacklisted by member journals
	    -  Institute can take action
- Publication criteria for- "Minimum Qualifications for Teachers in Medical Institutions (Amendment) Regulations, 2019"
