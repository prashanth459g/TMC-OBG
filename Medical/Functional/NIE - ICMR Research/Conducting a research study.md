# Conducting a research study
### Ethical framework for health research
- Ethical foundation is crucial for research, including health research
    - Any research involving human participants should follow international standards of ethics
    - Indian national standards are not less exacting and Indian ethical guidelines are on par with international guidelines
    - Ethics review is also expected in situations involving no risk when available data are used or minimal risk such as when only questions are asked, no samples/ other specimens are collected
- Evolution of various guidance documents has greatly improved the practice of ethics in biomedical research
	- INTERNATIONAL
		- 1947, Nuremberg Code
			- Initiated discussion on rationale and justification of research risk benefit analysis, competence of investigators and voluntary consent in research
		- 1964, Helsinki Declaration, Revised 1983, 1989, 1996, 2000, 2008, 2013
			- Commitment to individual rights to make informed decisions, investigators� duties, research participants� welfare, vulnerability
		- 1978-79, Belmont report
			- Described the basic ethics principles of autonomy, justice and beneficence, emphasized informed consent and review by ethics committee
		- 1992-93, CIOMS guidelines [Council for International organizations on Medical Sciences and WHO], Revised 2002
			- Reporting of adverse drug reactions and safety of research participants, benefit-risk balance, need and principles of pharmacovigilance,
		- 1996, ICH [International Council on Harmonization]
			- Good Clinical Practice
	- NATIONAL GUIDELINES -> Indian Council of Medical Research introduced Ethical Guidelines for Research on Human Participants
		- National Ethical Guidelines for Biomedical and Health Research Involving Human Participants; ICMR, 2017. Available from [link to ICMR PDF](https://www.icmr.nic.in/sites/default/files/guidelines/ICMR_Ethical_Guidelines_2017.pdf)
			- All institutions in the country which carry out any form of biomedical research involving human beings should follow these guidelines in letter and spirit to protect safety and well being of all individuals.
		- There are several other national guidelines available
			- Genome Policy and Genetic Research [2000], Indian GCP [2001], Amendment of Drugs and Cosmetics Act [2002], Assisted Reproductive Technology [2005], Stem Cell Research and Bio-banking [2006]
- Researchers must follow the following ethical principles
	- Respect for autonomy
	    - Autonomy is Latin for "self-rule" - We have an obligation to respect the decisions made by people concerning their own lives. This is respecting human dignity.
	    - We must not interfere with the decisions of competent adults, and also actively empower others for whom we are responsible.
	- Justice
	    - We have an obligation to provide all with whatever they are deserve. Basically, we have an obligation to treat all people equally, fairly, and impartially.
	    - All individuals should have an opportunity to participate in research unless contraindicated and we must not impose unfair burdens.
	- Beneficence
	    - We must be fair and correct in all our actions and must take positive steps to prevent harm.
	    - Sometimes in our endeavor to pursue beneficence, we place ourselves in direct conflict with respecting the autonomy of people.
	- Non-maleficence
	    - We must not harm others: "First, do no harm", and wherever harm cannot be avoided, we must try to minimize the same.
	    - It is wrong to waste resources that could be used for good.
- What is **informed consent**?
    - Informed consent is the process of informing the potential participants about the proposed research in a systematic manner and empower them to take an informed decision to participate in the research study
	    - Understand study procedures and risks and benefits
	    - Get all questions and concerns answered
	    - Take a learned and informed decision to [or not to] participate
    - This process can be repeated several times during the research study if necessary
    - Although group consent is desirable [e.g. tribal studies], it cannot replace individual consent
- Informed consent document
    - ![[Pasted image 20220308170855.png]]
- Stakeholders in informed consent process
    - Researchers and institutions:
	    - Information -> discussion and explanation -> comprehension -> voluntary decision
    - Participants:
	    - Informed, free and independent consent without coercion or force
    - Sponsors, monitors, regulators:
	    - Assess fairness of consenting procedure
	    - Verify consent documentation of research participants
- Issues related to informed consent
    - Whom does informed consent benefit?
	    - The research participant
	    - The investigator
    - Is the research procedure adequately explained in the IC form?
	    - The language, simplicity and clarity
	    - Translations and back-translations, certification of translations
	    - Test of understanding
    - Issue of witness to consent procedure
	    - Impartial witness
    - Can there be different types of informed consents
	    - Traditional written IC form
	    - Pictorial consent
- Importance of **scientific review**
	- Explores the scientific novelty, rationality and relevance
	 1. Justification for conducting the trial in the context of national priorities
	 2. Scientific merits of the research project and feasibility: Review of toxicological studies, laboratory and animal data
	 3. Technology transfer and capacity building at sites
 - Soundness of the study design: 
	 - Inclusion-exclusion criteria, 
	 - Sample size, 
	 - Randomization/ blinding procedures 
	 - End-point assessment 
	 - Study procedures and follow-up schedule 
	 - Pharmacy plan 
 - Scientifically well-planned research studies are more likely to correctly address human subjects and ethical issues
- Objectives of **regulatory review**
    - Evaluate pre-clinical trials data
    - Assess in-country regulatory requirements for drug/ vaccine/ product import
    - Ensure national requirements for special situations -genetically engineered products, stem cell research, research on reproductive technologies, organ transplantation etc.
    - Sample shipment and transfers, transfer of raw data: IPR issues
    - Exchange of scientists or visitors
    - Budget: Foreign funding
    - Research in border or high-security areas
- Careful regulatory review results in answering some of the ethical concerns
- Range of ethical issues that need to be addressed in health research
    - Competence of the researchers and the research team
    - Provisions for protection of human rights and ethical issues: vulnerable populations, women, children
    - Measures for protecting confidentiality and non-discriminatory practices
    - Appropriateness of Informed consent and study specific educational material
    - Mechanisms for reporting and management of adverse events and serious adverse events
    - Care and support for research participants: standard of care, long-term care, post-trial access to care and product
    - Reimbursement and compensation
    - Continuing review of progress of the study
- Main responsibility of **institutional ethics committees** or *institutional review board*
    - Does the study have real/ potential individual/ community benefit?
    - Are the rights of research participants adequately protected?
    - Does the potential benefit far overweigh the risks associated with research participation?
    - Will the participants and communities have access to study findings and benefits of research?
    - What is the mechanism for provision of safety, care and support to research participants?
- Ethics influencing health research and practice of medicine .
    - Growing expectation about accountability:
	    - Questioning of Government responsibility [local, state and national] and investigators responsibility
	    - Growing public awareness due to advocacy movement
    - Collective demand for health benefits - Universal right to health care (health for all)
    - Place for self responsibility (lifestyle) - should it always be researchers to be blamed for mishaps
    - Need for including bioethics in medical curriculum being increasingly stressed
- Ethics review at current times
	- There is hope
		- Ethics in practice of public health and health research is being increasingly addressed.
	- There are challenges
		- Public expectations and demands will continue to increase.
	- The search for solution should be an ongoing process
		- Public health system, policy makers, researchers and program managers should show enough sensitivity and realize that there is a scope for further improvement

	- Hello, in this course of Health Research Fundamentals, today we are going to talk about and discussabout some of the ethical issues in health and biomedical research.It is important that, we as researchers know what these issues are and how to protect thewelfare and safety of the research participants that are going to be as a part of our research.It is always important to remember that ethical foundation is considered as implicit for conductingany kind of research and it is applicable not only to health research, but to any researchin general.There are certain international guidelines that have been set in, there are certain internationalstandards and we have to be within those standards.But we also have to remember that, there are Indian national standards that are available,which have been developed by Indian Council of Medical Research and they are not at allless exacting and we have to follow these guidelines as well.Ethics review is expected in situations sometimes there is a feeling that ethics review is importantonly in cases where there is a significant risk involved, some invasive procedures involved,but that is not true.Even when we are using available data, where we say that there is no risk involved to humanparticipants, ethics review is required.Also, there are sometimes some situations when minimum risk is involved say like onlyquestions are asked to people were no samples and specimens are collected.Even in these situations ethics review is considered important and mandatory.In the past so many decades, many international documents have been developed and that havehelped for improving the practice of ethics in biomedical research.This all started with some kind of experimentation that was done in the World War II, among thecaptives and after that whatever happened, the people felt that lot of atrocities gotcommitted and human subjects where used for research in an improper way and lot of discussionsstarted on that.One effort in this direction which began very early was the development of the NurembergCode in 1947, which started some discussion related to the rational and justificationof research, basically whether that particular research is necessary?What is the risk benefit analysis?How it is important in deciding whether that particular research is important or not?Also, looking at the competence of investigators and also initiated some discussion on thevoluntary consent in any kind of research.Thereafter, for the first time many countries came together and met and they signed on adocument, what is called as Helsinki Declaration in 1964, which got revised several times afterthat and the latest revision came up in 2013.Helsinki Declaration, basically talks about commitment to individual rights to make informeddecisions, but at the same time also emphasizes duties of investigators.Also, talks about patients rights, research participants welfare and in addition talksabout certain groups that are considered as vulnerable and it is necessary that certainsteps are taken to protect their interest.In the United States, in 78-79 Belmont report was published, which described the basic ethicsprinciples of autonomy, justice and beneficence and we are going to cover this during thisparticular session a little later.And it also reemphasized the importance of informed consent in research and here wasfor the first time the importance of review by ethics committees, which are called asInstitutional Review Board in the west, it was emphasized.Again in 1992-93, the Council of International Organization on Medical Sciences and WHO calledCIOMS, they developed the document called as CIOMS guidelines and which was revisedin 2002.This is another important international document, which provides guidelines regarding reportingof adverse events and safety of research participants.This is particularly significant in case of clinical research and clinical trials, whereexperimentation is done, in case of new drugs and new vaccines and so on.It also talked about benefit and risk balance and need and principles of pharmacovigilance.So, it was stressed for the first time that by doing phase 1, 2 and 3 studies our responsibilitydoes not end, but probably we need to do a continued surveillance in the population tofigure out, what is happening on as far as the long term safety of these interventionsare concerned.In 1996, the International Council on Harmonization, ICH as it is popularly called as developedbasic guidelines for good clinical practice.Subsequently, taking the basic clues from this particular document, good clinical laboratorypractice document has been developed; good clinical epidemiological practice, a documenthas been developed.So, it found lot of applications in different spheres of health related research.India was not far behind in developing its own documents.The Indian Council of Medical Research in 2000 for the first time introduced EthicalGuidelines for Research on Human Participants.This was a major consensus document, which was produced and got revised in 2006 and isagain in the process of revision, which might happen in the next year that is 2016.This document is available on the website of Indian Council of Medical Research.Basically, it gives the guidance for all the institutions in the country, which carry outany kind of biomedical or health research, which involves human beings and provides theguidelines that people have to follow, the researchers have to follow to protect thesafety and well being of all individuals.But in addition to that there are several other national guidelines, which are alsoavailable which include the document on genome policy and genetic research.There has been an amendment to Drugs and Cosmetic Act in the early 2000, which is available.There are guidelines available for stem cell research, assisted reproductive technologies,bio banking and researchers working in these areas have to be aware of the guidelines,which have been provided and stick to those.I earlier mentioned that there are certain important basic ethical principles.Among them respect for autonomy, justice, beneficence and non-maleficence, these arethe ones, which have to be considered.Autonomy is considered as basically is a Latin word for self-rule, which means we have torespect individuals for what they are and this is like respecting human dignity andso we must not interfere in what people feel like doing or what peoples thought processesare.But at the same time also indicates that all those people who are not adequately awarehave to be empowered to understand, what this is all about as well.Basically, what it means is people should be clearly informed that they have a rightto decide to participate in research or not to participate in research.The next principle, which is of justice, it emphasizes that we have an obligation to provideall with whatever they deserve.Basically, what it means is the participants or if there is an obligation to treat allpeople equally, fairly and impartially.So here, what is required is the benefit of research should be extended to everybody andexcept in certain situations there are certain groups like say, for example, condition likepregnancy, when women cannot participate in research.So, unless contraindicated, all groups should have an opportunity to participate in research,but this should never be imposed on anybody.The next two principles, like they just go hand in hand.Beneficence means we must do everything which is fair and which is correct and we shouldbe correct in our actions and in our deeds also and we should take only positive stepsto prevent any kind of harm, this is an important thing.Non-maleficence is the other side of it, we must do everything to do things to help people,we should also not cause any harm to others.So, do no harm is the principle or the explanation of what we called by non-maleficence.So, whenever harm is evident, see whenever we talk about any new drug trial for example,there is always expectation that some kind of a side effect would always be there.What we have to really ensure as researchers is that we take appropriate steps to ensurethat this harm would be minimum and if at all it occurs appropriate care is taken careof.So, whenever we conduct any kind of a research, we have to ensure that these basic ethic principlesor ethical principles are followed.And one way to assure this is through a process is what is called as informed consent.This is a process as I very specifically mentioned because sometimes it is not a onetime event,it is not a tick mark.It is a very systematic way in which the proposed research is explained to the potential participantsin a systematic step by step process and the potential participants are empowered to takean informed decision to participate in the research study.What does it involve actually?So, that the participants have to understand, what the study procedures are and what arethe risks and benefits of their participation?They can ask, they can have the liberty to ask all kinds of questions and raise theirconcerns which have to be appropriately answered and then finally, the participants take avery appropriate learned and informed decision to participate or not to participate in thestudy.So, there could be several sessions that could be involved in completing this process.A certain individual may understand the whole process in one single sitting.For an individual, it may require multiple sittings and multiple sessions, but the researchershave to be persistent and perseverant to take the potential participants through this processmeticulously.In certain situations, like when we work in a certain tribal populations, institutionalsetups, it is important to take a group consent or consent from the concerned authorities,but one has to remember that this kind of a consent does not replace the individualconsent.The informed consent, it is classically a document, which explains various things andso the document has at its header, the name of the project and the agency that is conductingthis particular research and the main body of this particular document talks about variousthings like, it describes the research study in brief, it talks about the potential risks,it talks about the benefits.Sometimes, it is possible that when research is conducted, benefits are not necessarilyindividual oriented.The research might cause benefit to the whole community and that has to be explained correctly.Their alternatives have to be explained in the sense that participants have to be explainedthat, even if they decide not to participate in research, it is just fine and they willcontinue to get the services as they would otherwise get even if they decide not to participate.In addition, the researchers have to commit and give the assurance of confidentiality,keeping their records confidential because sometimes some sensitive information getscollected and participants may be worried about the information that their sharing withthe research team and so it is important that they have to be given this assurance of confidentiality.Sometimes, some harm that results as a part of research participation has to be appropriatelycompensated and that clause also is essential as a part of the informed consent processes.We have to also give some basic important contact information as to whom the researchparticipants can contact for any additional information, for any concerns that they mayhave during participation of the study and this information should be clearly included.In addition, one of the most important clauses that gets added is about voluntary participation.The document has to emphasize that the every person has a right to decide whether to participatein the research study or not.Also, during the part of the research study and this becomes particularly important whenit is a long term follow up study.A person may decide to drop out of the study at a certain point of time and it is perfectlywithin the rights of the individual to do so and this has to be explained.So, all these constitute the body of the informed consent and towards the end of this particularform, the signature of participant and if the participant is illiterate, then the signatureof a witness who is not a part of the study team has to be obtained.There are various stakeholders in this informed consent process.In research, please understand that this informed consent procedure is considered as a veryimportant procedure and it is a very sacrosanct procedure.We as researchers have to understand that we and our institutions have an obligationto provide the required information, which is good in length and also in-depth to theparticipants.They should be given a chance to discuss their issues, their problems.They should be provided with adequate explanation.We have to also ensure that they have understood the information that is being given to themwith respect to the research study appropriately and then also ensure that they take a voluntarydecision; there is no coercion or coaxing on part of the researchers.On part of the participants, who are the other kinds of stakeholders in this whole process,they have to themselves ensure that, they have understood whatever has been told tothem.They just should not sign the informed consent form without understanding what goes behindthat or what is included under that.They have to understand their rights, they have to understand various provisions, theresearchers or scientists are going to make as a part of the informed consent document.Basically, they should sign the form freely, independently and without any coercion orforce.The third kind of stakeholders in this process includes the sponsors, the monitors or regulatorshere.These are the kind of agencies that assess the fairness of the consenting processes atvarious levels.This starts right from the beginning of the research study before it gets approved bythe institutional ethics committee right up to monitoring throughout the procedure bythe monitors and regulators as well.They also have an authority to verify the consent documentation of research participants.So, every person who is involved in research has a combined responsibility to ensure thatinformed consent is appropriately taken.There are certain issues around that, whom does the informed consent benefit?It benefits everybody really; I talked about some stakeholders here.So, from the research participant point of view, it gives him lot of information andit therefore it is important for him, for the investigator it is a documentation thatthis particular process has been completed in the best possible way in the most appropriateway.What is important to understand is whether the research procedure and various other aspectsof research are adequately explained in the informed consent form.So, the language has to be simple.There has to be lot of clarity on various issues, it should be in the local language.So, it is also advised that the consent form which is developed in the local language isback translated and then either it is certified or checked with the original English consentform for its accuracy.Some investigators have tried doing test of understanding also and this is consideredas one of the good practices.Once, the informed consent form is done, some kind of a small objective type of test isquickly given to the research participants to assess, whether the understanding on theinformed consent form has been adequate or not.The issue of witness can become a critical issue.This becomes particular important in scenarios, where the people are not literate and theycannot sign the informed consent form.So, here is where, there is a need to have an impartial witness.It is important to ensure that the principal investigator, researcher himself does notsign as the impartial witness.It should be somebody, who is not connected with the research process.There has been a lot, which has been talked about, whether the oral consent is valid ornot.Typically, there should be two informed consent forms to be signed and then one has to bereturned back to the participant, which the participant can keep with him for record becauseit also provides lot of answers to the questions that might arise in the mind of the participantsubsequently.There has been some discussion going on with respect to audio consent and video consent,well the regulatory authorities in India have now made it mandatory to record the consentprocedures in case of investigation in new drugs in India.So, this is an important regulation which we must keep in mind.Different types of reviews have to take place before any kind of study becomes ready tobe undertaken there actually.There is a scientific review and regulatory review, which takes place before the actualethics review happens.The scientific review looks at the novelty, the rationality and relevance of the study.Basically, what is the justification of doing this particular study?What are the scientific merits?Whether appropriate study procedures have been done, have been taken into consideration?What are the inclusion exclusion criteria?Whether the sample size has been calculated appropriately?How will the endpoint or the outcomes going to be assessed?So, these aspects are normally looked at in the scientific review.Why this is important is because scientifically well planned research studies are often likelyto be correctly addressing the human subject issues and also the ethical issues.So, if the science is good often it takes care of ethics which is behind that.Similarly, regulatory reviews look at the various aspects like the pre-clinical trialsdata that has been done.This is particularly important in case of newer drugs, newer vaccines, various animaldata that is there, toxicology data that is there.then there are certain in country regulatory assessments for various drug vaccine or productimports, they have to be assessed and this is important if there are certain trials orexperiments which are being done using the products that have been developed abroad.There could be certain special situations, where genetically engineered products arebeing used or there is a stem cell research, research on the reproductive technology, organtransplantation etcetera and so the concerned regulatory agencies have to ensure that allthe necessary guidelines have been followed here.The issues around sample shipment and transfer as well as transfer of raw data is lookedat very seriously by the Government of India because there are issues around the intellectualproperty rights in this area and the government is very protective about those.So one, the researchers have to know these issues fairly well and the regulation in thisregard as well.There are certain sort of caveats; there are certain kind of restrictions regarding exchangeof scientists and visitors.The funding particularly, if there is foreign funding coming in for a project to be donein India and during such situations, where the research is to be done in the border orhigh security areas and the researchers have to be aware of the regulatory requirementsin such situations.Again, like scientific review, careful regulatory review also results in answering some of theethical concerns.Now, coming to the various ethical issues that need to be addressed; well, it is importantthat the competence of researchers and a research team has to be accessed appropriately.Then whatever are the provisions made for protection of human rights and vulnerablepopulations, in particular they have to be accessed.Then measures for protecting confidentiality, they have to be seen.Appropriateness of the informed consent form, the correct completeness of the informed consentform has to be assessed.Mechanism for reporting and management of adverse events and serious adverse events,this is particularly important in case of drug trials.Then care and support mechanism for participants, is the support going to be extended to theparticipants after the trial?Will the post trial benefits be given to the community after the trial is finished andis proved to be useful?These aspects also have to be looked at from the ethical angle.The reimbursements and compensation are important issues, which the ethics review looks at.Because one has to ensure that reimbursement is for the time lost and also the expensespaid for traveling to the clinical research site.But the compensation or the incentive given or the money that is given should not be asmuch as to course the participant to participate in the research trial.So, this decision is also made by the ethics committee.And it is also important to continue the review of the progress of the study till it is completed.So, the committee which really looks at all these things is what is called as InstitutionalEthics Committee in India.It is called as Institutional Review Board abroad.Basically, it looks at whether the study has potential benefits or community benefits?Whether the rights of the participants are adequately protected?Whether the benefits of this particular study out with the risks that are involved here?Whether the participants and communities have access to study findings?Whether they are eventually going to benefit from the research participation?And what kinds of mechanisms are built-in to provide the safety and care and supportto research participations even during the study and after the study?So, there are growing expectations about accountability from the researchers now.Various researchers are being questioned about their responsibility and governments' responsibilityas well in fairly conducting research.There is a growing public awareness also; all this is eventually going to improve thequality of research in our country and also, the practice of medicine in our country overa period of time.There is a collective demand for health benefits, people are demanding.So, universal right to health care which emanates from the principal of health for all.So, this which demands that more and more research will have to be conducted in makingmore and more benefits available to the common man of this particular country.It is also important to understand that it is not only the researchers who have the completeresponsibility to follow ethics.It is also important that the research participants follow certain or fulfill certain expectations.So, whatever has been described in research they have to follow appropriately.It is explained in the informed consent form and so there is a great need for includingbioethics in the medical curriculum which is being stressed.There is certainly a hope because ethics in the practice of public health and in healthresearch is being increasingly addressed.We know that there are challenges as well because the public expectations and demandsare continuously increasing, but we will continue to find solutions and this has to be an ongoingprocess.For this, various public health stakeholders like public health system, policy makers,researchers and program managers, they should show adequate sensitivity and realize thatwe always can improve and a practice always can improve.
### Conducting clinical trials
- Scenario of clinical trials in India
    - The clinical trial industry rapidly expanded in the first decade of 21st century, but has faced some challenges due to regulatory reforms in 2012-13
    - The main challenges perceived by international investigators and sponsors include
	    - Delayed approval
	    - Quality of ethics review
	    - Shipment of samples: import and export
	    - Overall deficiency of duly trained investigators and centers
	    - Clause of compensation even for clinical trial participants
	    - Recent requirement of audio visual recording of consent process for IND [investigational new drug] trials, only in specified situations
- Scientific, ethical and regulatory reviews of clinical trials are critical

|Concerns in implementation of research protocols | **Type of review**| Some examples of available agencies/ mechanisms |
|-|-|-|
|Is the research question sound?| Scientific review| Institutional Scientific Advisory Committee Indian Council of Medical Research|
| Is the safety and welfare of the research participants adequately protected?| Ethical review| Institutional Ethics Committee Central/ National Ethics Committee|
| Are the research methods appropriate?| Regulatory review| Health Ministry Screening Committee Drug Controller General of India, Genetic Engineering Approval Committee|

- Addressing ethical issues in clinical trials
    - Is there a mechanism for independent ethical review? [Approvals from Ethics Committee and in country Regulatory Authority]
    - Which mechanisms exist to ensure protection of human subjects throughout trial participation?
    - Is there adequate community engagement and support?
    - Informed consent
    - Standard of care and post-trial support
    - Use of placebos
    - Confidentiality
- Critical issues in **trial implementation** 
    1. Informed consent procedure
    2. Screening and enrollment: Strict adherence to inclusion and exclusion criteria
    3. Good clinical and laboratory practice, quality control and quality assurance
    4. Adherence to intervention and follow-up
    5. Multi-centric trials: standardization of study protocols
    6. Independent monitoring
    7. Safety assessment: Reporting and management of adverse and serious adverse events [clinical, laboratory and social/ familial]
    8. Reimbursements, compensation and grievance redressal
    9. Trial stoppage rules
    10. Documentation archival
- Impediments in clinical trial participation
	- At the level of patients
	    - Don't know about clinical trials
	    - Don't have access to clinical trials
	    - May be afraid or suspicious of research
	    - Can't afford to participate
	    - May not want to go against health care provider's wishes
	- At the level of health care providers
	    - Lack awareness of appropriate clinical trials
	    - Be unwilling to "lose control" of a person's care
	    - Believe that standard therapy is best
	    - Be concerned that clinical trials add administrative burdens
- RCTs

	- Hello.In the course of Health Research Fundamentals, today I am going to discuss the experimentalstudy designs or clinical trials.The scenario of clinical trials in India has changed over the last 25 to 30 years.In the late 20th century, what was happening was, mostly the clinical trials that wereundertaken were by the research institute and also by the pharmaceutical industry, whichwere limited in nature.But, towards the beginning of 21st century, in the first decade in particular, the clinicaltrials industry in India grew and expanded very, very rapidly.But in the present decade, it has been facing some kind of challenges because of variousregulatory reforms that have happened recently.But overall, the international community particularly the international investigators and sponsors,who want to undertake high quality clinical trials perceive that there are certain challengesfor conducting clinical trials in India.They feel the important ones among them include, the approvals are often delayed; approvalsin terms of the ethical approvals, by the ethics committees as well as the regulatoryapprovals by the regulatory authorities.There are also concerns about the quality of ethical review that takes place becauseit has been only in the recent times, a very systematic effort is being taken to improvethe performance of various ethics committees of research organizations in particular.The shipment of samples and transfer of data has always been an issue for internationalstudies in particular because government has some specific restrictions and regulationsabout transfer of the data as well as samples.It is also felt that, there is an overall lack of duly certified and trained investigatorsas well as centers in India and again a very systematic effort in this direction is ongoingin the country.What has happened as a part of the regulatory reforms are two important changes suggestednow and there is a specific clause of compensation, which has now come up for clinical trial participantsand the office of the Drug Controller General of India has given very specific recommendationsabout how this compensation has to be calculated and up to what period these laws are applicable,that has put in some kind of pressure on the people, who are conducting the trial and thereis some kind of haziness around this particular area.Also, in the area of audio visual recording of informed consent process, all of us willcertainly agree that to make ourselves very accountable, to make ourselves very transparent,probably this is the best procedure.If we protect the confidentiality of the trial participant adequately, but carry out audiovisual recording that is possibly the best proof of how the consent procedure was actuallyundertaken here.It is currently applicable to mostly the IND trials, which are Investigational New Drugtrials, but again people are confusing this.They are trying to do it in all different kinds of scenario and some kind of thinking,rethinking on this particular matter is happening at the center on this particular thing inIndia.. But, for any clinical trial to happen or tostart, certain approvals are mandated and they have to be taken in.It all starts with the scientific review; it is a very systematically planned experiment,very meticulously planned.Every step is outlined in detail and basically, what we ensure through the scientific reviewis whether the research question is sound and usually it is the Institutional ScientificAdvisory Committee that decides, whether the study designs that is being proposed hereis appropriate.All the methods that are being described under that are accurate and correct.Then, it goes to the next stage of what is called as the Ethical review.It is done by the Institutional Ethics Committee; sometimes at the national level also it canbe done by National Ethics Committee as well.We do it, in our set up of Indian Council of Medical Research and what is really lookedat here, is whether the safety and welfare of the research participants is adequatelyprotected or not?This is a very significant aspect of a clinical trial.This review is considered very critical, why?Because, the basic principle is, we should do no harm to research participants by makingthem participate in a research study and that is a very critical component, which we haveto keep in mind.Another kind of review that happens is that of regulate, which we call it as a Regulatoryreview.Sometimes it is new drugs, so the setup in our country is the previous Drug ControllerGeneral of India, which is now the Standards Control Organization, that we have CDSCO.Sometimes, if the project is getting funded internationally, then there is a health ministryscreening committee, which looks at various regulations around that particular issue.If there are genetically modified or engineered products being used then there is a GeneticEngineering Approval Committee, which looks at that.It is the responsibility of the sponsors and investigators to find out, what kind of regulatoryapprovals are required for the kind of clinical trial that is being undertaken and all thoseclinical trial approvals must be taken before initiating the study.Appropriate certification has to be kept on file for ready review by the external monitorsor by any other agencies that are authorized.. But one of the most important things thathas to be kept in mind is because it is an experimental study, because we are manipulatingthe environment, we have to take care of a lot of ethical issues that can arise in thisparticular scenario.Primarily, the most important thing is have all the approvals been sort for this particularthing, which include the scientific, the ethical as well as the regulatory approval, whichis currently the norm in the country at any point of time.Then what?Just getting the initial approvals is not enough; to ensure that the patients or theparticipants are protected all throughout the trial is also critically important andso some role of ethics committee to monitor this particular process is also important.Is there an adequate community engagement and support for this?Somehow, it has so happened that sometime when the people were not made aware of someof the interventions that where being tried at the national level, there where backlashesbecause there where something which where believe to be culturally not acceptable andhence it is always important to engage the community and face of the community is visiblethrough many groups.They may be the private practitioners and doctors, they may be the program managersof the country, they may be the doctor attending to the patients, they may be the politicalpeople who are taking say, sort of care of the interest of the people and so on and soforth.One of the important things is to be remembered is every single participant has to sign aninformed consent form before participating in a clinical trial.Any trial without an informed consent form is a problem and we have to ensure that thisparticular process is completed.Also, after the trial gets completed, probably the responsibility of the investigator doesnot necessarily end.There has to be some kind of a mechanism for providing follow-up care to or post-trialsupport to the trial participants and that maybe all well thought of right ahead of timeand planned in the research protocol.Use of placebos has raised some questions in the past and it is a topic in itself, butwherever there is a vaccine which we are talking about, where there is no comparable vaccineavailable earlier of that particular disease, doing use of placebos is considered as justifiable.One of the important things which is an ethical issue, is the confidentiality of the studyparticipants.The study participants sometimes are worried that nobody other than them, even in theirown family should know about their research participation and it is our duty as investigatorsor researchers to protect this interest of the participant and to actually keep all theinformation totally confidential.. As I said, the whole process of clinical trialsstarts with the informed consent process procedure.I have deliberately used this word, it is a procedure and it can be multiple step procedurealso.Some patients and some participants may not be able to finish this particular processin one single sitting.You may require multiple sittings to explain the things.The word ‘informed consent’ here is to be critically looked at, informed is wherethe duty of the investigator is to explain all the study procedures to the study participantvery carefully and also ensure that any question or doubt the person might have is appropriatelyanswered.This has to be now documented, all of us know this.And now, there is also an insistence that for clinical trials it should be, a duplicatecopy should be signed and because it is a document, which give some information aboutthe study also.One copy should be kept by the patient and the other should be kept with the investigatorsteam.The process of clinical trial participation is generally two step: There is a screeningprotocol first, wherein those who are interested in participating in the trial undergo somelevel of screening that is the interview, followed by medical examination, followedby some samples collection and it is ensured that they fit into the eligibility criteriaand because as investigators, we have to adhere to the inclusion and exclusion criteria veryspecifically.It is important that the investigators follow good clinical and laboratory practice.This is absolutely important, this has to be followed all throughout the trial and whatthis means?This is, although this looks like something like a common sense.Do the enrollments as exactly as have been defined in the protocol.Do the study procedures as they have been defined in the protocol.Collect the volume of blood as has been defined in the study protocol; ensure that all thevisits are made.So, these are the basic procedures, there are responsibilities for the sponsors, thereare responsibilities for the investigators.All of them have to follow this.In clinical trials, one of the most important things, which we have to ensure, is adherenceto the intervention.If it is a drug trial, we have to ensure somehow that the patient is taking the drug regularly.If it is adherence with respect to follow-up evaluation, also we have to ensure that theperson comes for follow up at the define time intervals.Say for example, we are asking a particular participant to participate in a vaccine trialand if we want to study, periodically up to 2 years from giving that particular dose ofvaccine, till what length of time, the vaccine immunogenicity or the antibody levels to thatparticular vaccine candidate are maintained and if it is decided that once in every 3months, this evaluation will be done.If patients miss some of these visits, it is very likely that we will miss some of theimportant data because we may not be able to decide up to what level the antibodieswere maintained and beyond which they were not maintained.There can be a lot of issues which can arise in case of multi-centric trials.Sometimes, trials are conducted in 5, 6, 7, 10, 50 centers in the country and here iswhere, this is done with the basic purpose is sometimes, it becomes very difficult fora few sites to gather the required number of study participants.So, multiple large number of centers have to be used, but the compromise that we makehere is the quality can come down particularly, variations can occur within the proceduresthat are adopted in various centers and hence, one of the key elements here is the standardizationof the study protocols.Training of the people right in the beginning, periodic training of the people and also thenusing very standard well defined protocols is something which is absolutely important.
	- Also in a clinical trial, one of the important prerequisites is to make some kind of an arrangementfor an independent monitoring mechanism.This is an agency, which you generally employed by the sponsor and that carries out independentmonitoring, looks at for the adherence to GCP, dispensing of study products, how therecords are maintained, how informed consent procedure is happening and so on and so forth.This particular agency has to have a total third party view in doing that particularassessment and should not be influenced either by the sponsors or by the investigators.
	- As we know, as I have been mentioning right from the beginning, safety is one of the mostimportant thing as far as clinical trials are concerned and maintaining or ensuringsafety of research participants is of paramount importance and hence, the safety assessmentsare built in all clinical trials.What is also important is, there are very well defined reporting mechanisms for managementof various kinds of adverse and serious adverse events as they happen in, among the clinicaltrial participants and they have to be timely reported to the regulatory authorities aswell as sponsors as well as ethical committees.We have to remember that all the adverse events may not necessarily be clinical.Sometimes, they can be odd laboratory values or they could be even social or familial problemsthat are happening as a part of clinical trial participation.All these pieces of information have to be appropriately trapped.Generally, there is an agreement that some kind of reimbursements should be made to thetrial participants.One is for the kind of time they spent in coming over there and the loss of daily wagesthat might happen as a result of that and also for the travel cost involved, plus maybesome kind of food expenses, which are made particularly, in case of trials which requirelong term participation of the study participants.So, but here is where a clear understanding has to be there as to we should know thatwe are doing reimbursements and we are not doing incentives because sometimes incentivescan become coercive.In the sense, the incentives can persuade patients to participate in the trials, evenif they are not interested, if the amounts are really large.Recently, some kind of laws and regulation has come in with respect to compensation.We have to be all aware of what is prevalent regulation in the country with respect tothe clause of compensation.It is also important that we have a mechanism for grievance redressal, some of the researchparticipants because it is an experiment and some kind of a experimental intervention isbeing tried and the some of the people might come up with some kind of complaints, whichthe investigators may feel are not related to the intervention that is being tried, butthe patients keep insisting that it is essentially related to that and hence, there has to bea kind of third party body and it is always believed that grievance redressal team shouldbe there, which is easily available to address these issues in real time.
	- Every single trial has to have a defined trial stoppage rule right in the beginning itself. Generally, 3 serious adverse events which are defined as maybe; deaths or very seriouscomplications on the previous clinical condition that is what happening, hospitalization dueto any cause, these are considered as serious adverse events. So, after any 3 serious adverse events, it is normally decided whether they are related or not related to the trial by a third party body called as **Data Safety Monitoring Board**,which is an independent entity, which is also predefined earlier and when they allow us to move forward, we move forward in the clinical trial, but these rules have to be definedup front.
	- Another important thing in a clinical trial is documentation archival.Various sponsors have various expectations with respect to this; some of the trial sponsorsrequire this.All the trial related documents to be stored for a period of 5 years, sometimes 10 yearsand sometimes 15 years, whatever are the regulations we have to comply with that particular expectation.There could be some impediments in clinical trial participations.At the patients’ level, many times patients do not know about the clinical trials.Sometimes, they do not have access to clinical trials.There is mistrust, suspicion or people are afraid of being participating in clinicaltrials.Sometimes, they feel there are fees attached to this particular thing.If clinical trials have to succeed, patients have to agree or volunteers have to agreeto participate and hence, disseminating this particular information becomes extremely important.Sometimes, there are some issues at the level of health care providers also.There is a lack of awareness of appropriate clinical trials that sometimes they are unwillingto lose controls of person’s care, say for example, a trial is going on in cancer patients,there could be some kind of a fear among health care providers that they would lose theirpatients to this particular trial once it is referred.Sometimes, they believe that the standard therapy is best and could be also concernedabout the administrative burdens that this may add.So, even if there are impediments here the clinical trials are the only way for makinga progress in medical science.Because, if there are no clinical trials, no new drugs will come, if there are no clinicaltrials, no new technologies will be tested, no new vaccines will be tested and so theymust be supported and the adequate information about clinical trials must be disseminated.Randomized controlled clinical trials have to be carried out in the best possible manner,with the highest possible quality adherence.Thank you for your attention.
