##  Measurement of disease frequency
- *Population at risk*
    - Portion of a population that is susceptible to a disease
    - Can be defined on the basis of demographic or environmental factors
	- Population at risk: Examples
	    - Population at risk of developing carcinoma of the cervix:
		    - Female population
		    - Age > 30 and < 70 years
	    - Population at risk of hepatitis B
		    - Those individuals anti-HBc negative
- *Prevalence* � (P)
    - Number of existing cases (old and new) in a defined population at a specified point of time 
	> number of people with disease at a specified time 
	> P = -------------------------------------------------------------- x 10n
	> Population at risk at the specified time   
	- In some studies the total population is used as an approximation if data on population at risk is not available
- **Point prevalence**
    - Measures the frequency of disease at a given point in time
    - Applies when the data has been collected at one point in time
    - P = C / N
    - C = # of observed cases at time �t�
    - N = Population size at time �t�
	- Example of point prevalence
	    - 150 children in a school
	    - Screening for refractory errors at time �t�
	    - 15 children require glasses
	    - Prevalence of refractory errors
	    - 15 / 150 = 10%
- **Period prevalence** - (PP)
    - Measures the frequency of disease over some time
    - Applies when the data has been collected over a period of time
    - PP = C + I / N
	    - C = # of prevalent cases at the beginning of the time period
	    - I = # of incident cases that develop during the period
	    - N = size of the population for this same time period
	- Exercise
	    - Scenario
		    - Population of 150 persons
		    - Follow up for one year
		    - 25 had a disease of interest at the beginning
		    - Another 15 new cases developed during the year
	    - Calculate:
		    - Point prevalence at the start of the period
		    - Period prevalence for the year
		- P = C/N = 25 /150 = 0.17 (17 %)
		- PP = (C+I)/N = (25+15)/150 = 0.27 (27 %)
- Factors influencing prevalence
    - *Number of new cases*
    - *Duration of the illness*
    - If the disease is short, the prevalence is reduced
	    - The prevalence of sudden infant death = 0
    - If the disease is long, the prevalence is increased
	    - Rare lifelong disease can accumulate to build up a large prevalence
- Causes of increase and decrease of prevalence
	- Increase
	    - Long duration
	    - Low cure rate
	    - Low case fatality
	    - Increase in new cases
	    - Immigration of patients
	    - Improved detection
	    - Emigration of healthy people
	- Decrease
	    - Shorter duration
	    - High cure rate
	    - High case fatality
	    - Decrease in new cases
	    - Emigration of patients
	    - Improved cure rate
	    - Immigration of healthy people
	- Conclusion: Changes in prevalence may have many causes and are difficult to interpret
- Uses of prevalence data
    - Assessing health care needs
    - Planning health services
    - Measure occurrence of conditions with gradual onset
    - Study chronic diseases
- *Incidence* (I)
    - Number of new cases in a given period in a specified population
    - Time, (i.e., day, month, year) must be specified
    - Measures the rapidity with which new cases are occurring in a population
    - Can be expressed:
	    - In absolute numbers
	    - In terms of cumulated incidence
	    - In terms of incidence density
- **Cumulated incidence** - (CI)  
	> number of new cases
	> CI = -------------------------------------------------- x 10n
	> Population at risk at the beginning
	- Also known as: *Attack rate*
	    - Assumes that the entire population at risk at the beginning was followed-up for the time period of observation
	- Risk
	    - Probability that an individual will experience a health status change over a specified follow up period
	    - This assumes that the individual does not:
		    - Have disease at the beginning
		    - Die from other causes during follow up
	    - Corresponds to cumulated incidence
- **Incidence density** - (ID)
	> number of new cases
	> ID = -------------------------------------------------- x 10n
	> Total person-time of observation
    - Also known as: *Incidence rate*
    - Reflects more exactly the person-time observed
- Uses of incidence data
    - Describe trends in diseases
    - Evaluate impact of primary prevention programme's
- The dynamic of incidence and prevalence
		- ![[Pasted image 20220207230945.png]]
	- The relation between prevalence and incidence
	    - Prevalence depends on
		    - Incidence (I)
		    - Duration of the disease (D)
		- P = I x D
	    - Change in prevalence from one time period to another may be the result of changes in incidence rates, changes in the duration of disease, or both
	- Patterns of incidence and prevalence
	    - High prevalence and low incidence
		    - e.g., Diabetes Mellitus
	    - Low prevalence and high incidence
		    - e.g., Common cold
- Case fatality
    - Place in relation the number of deaths from a disease to the number of cases
    - Reflects severity
    - Can be expressed as:
	    - Proportion
	    - Ratio
	    - Not as rate (Although often referred to as case fatality rate)
- Summary
    - Prevalence is a static measure taken at a point in time
    - Incidence is a dynamic measure taken over a certain time
    - Mortality is calculated using population denominators to reflect burden while case fatality is calculated using cases as denominators to reflect severity

	- Welcome to this session of Health Research Fundamentals. In this session, we are going  to see some measurements we commonly use to measure the Disease Frequency.  Before we go in for appropriate measurement of disease frequency, we need to understand  certain concepts like a Population at Risk. The population at risk are the portion of  population that is susceptible to a disease. That can be defined on the basis of demographic  or environmental factors.  Now, let us look at some example. The population at risk of developing carcinoma of cervix  is female population and in the age group of 30 to 70 years. A Population at risk of  hepatitis B are those individuals who are at risk of developing hepatitis B, but were  negative.  Now, let us look at a measure which is very often used in epidemiology in any health research.  As called prevalence, what you mean by prevalence? The prevalence is the number of existing cases  both old and new, in a defined population at a specified point of time. P is equal to  is the number of people with disease at specified time and that is divided by the population  at risk at this specified time and that quantity is multiplied by a factor by 10 or 10n.  In order to make that as, suppose whenever your population at risk is very large and  you have number of cases were small, you will get a value P as 0.001. So, in order to make  into a round number you multiplied by 1000, 10000 or 100000 depending on what the value  of P you get. So in some studies, the total population used as in approximation if data  on population at risk is not available because with the philosophy that everyone in the population  are at risk of developing a particular disease.  Again, this prevalence are broadly classified into say 2 different categories. We called  as one as a Point Prevalence and another one as a Period Prevalence. By point prevalence  what we mean is, this measures the frequency of disease at a given point of time, it is  like a snapshot. This applies when the data has been collected at one point in time. It  is denoted as P is equal to C by N, where C is the number of observed cases at that  particular point of time t and N is the population size at time point t.  The example of point prevalence is supposed, if there are 150 children in a school and  you are screening them for refractory errors, at a particular point of time t. And you find  15 children they require glasses, they have problem. Then the prevalence of refractory  errors is 15 divided by 150 which is equal to 10 and called a 10 percent of the school  children they have refractory errors or the point prevalence of refractory error in this  particular school is 10 percent.  The Period Prevalence is that measures the frequency of disease over a period of time.  This applies when the data has been collected over a period of time and it is denoted as  PP, which is equal to C plus I divided by N. What is C? C is the number of prevalent  cases at the beginning of the time period and I is the incident cases, that is the new  cases that develop during the period of your survey and sum of these two are divided by  N which is the size of the population for this same time period point.  Example of this period prevalence is you know, you take a scenario of a population of 150  persons and you follow up for 1 year. At the beginning of your survey the 25 had disease  of interest and another 15 new cases developed during the year. When we calculate it point  prevalence at the start of the period and period prevalence over the period of time.  Point prevalence is given by C divided N there is 25 by 150 or 0.17 or 17 percent. Period  prevalence is 25 plus 15 there is 40 over 150 it comes 0.27 that is 27 percent.  So, now there are several factors that influence the value of prevalence, the number of new  cases, the duration of illness. Suppose, if the duration of illness is short, the prevalence  is reduced. Say suppose, somebody gets disease and immediately you know either it cures or  it dies then it goes out of our calculation, with thus when we go there are no disease  persons. So, the prevalent of sudden infant deaths cut by times would be even 0 because  when you go if there are no deaths that are there, all the children who had the disease  had died. So, there are no cases at that particular point of time, so your prevalence may be 0.  And if disease is of very long duration, the prevalence you know it goes on suppose it  is in chronic diseases, a rare lifelong diseases it can accumulate to build up a very large  prevalence.  We have to be rather careful, what causes an increase or decrease in prevalence? An  increase in prevalence could be caused by long duration, just low cure rate or low case  fatality. And there are more number of new cases that have come back or there are some  immigration population patients who have with particular disease, if they immigrate into  a particular area they could rather enhance the prevalence. Prevalence could also be increased,  if there are new improved detection mechanism you try to you know detect more cases because  you have more sensitive test in your hand. And prevalence could also increase, if there  are healthy people going out of a particular region. So that your denominator is low and  your numerator is all unhealthy or disease people are there and so your prevalence may  increase. The decrease in the prevalence could happen exactly you know the opposite causes,  the shorter duration, high cure rate, high case fatality, the decrease in new cases,  immigration of patients, improved cure rates and immigration of healthy people. All these  could bring down the prevalence. So, to conclude the changes in prevalence may have many causes  and are difficult to interpret. So better we need to have a checklist of all these items  and then look at them all before we try to rather say that the prevalence has increased  or decreased over a period of time in a particular region.  What are the uses of prevalence data? Prevalence of data is used to assess health care needs.  It is very useful in planning health services because it measures the burden of disease,  and it measures occurrence of conditions with gradual onset and prevalence is very useful  in the study of chronic diseases.  Another important measure in epidemiology is the Incidence. The incidence is defined  as the number of new cases in a given period in a specified population that is time is  an important component, whether measure it by day or month or year, that must be specified  when you are mentioning the incidence. This measures the rapidity with which or the speed  of occurrence with which new cases are occurring in a population. This can be expressed in  absolute numbers, in terms of cumulated incidence or in terms of incidence density.  Let us rather look at the different aspects of the incidence. Let us rather take the cumulated  incidence first. The cumulative incidence is CI, is a number of new cases divided by  population at risk at the beginning that is multiplied by a factor of 10. This is known  as attack rate and it assumes that the entire population at risk at the beginning was followed-up  for the time period of observation.  Now, let us look at what do you mean by Risk? The risk is the probability that an individual  will experience a health status or change over a specified follow-up period. This assumes  that the individual does not have disease at the beginning and die from other causes  during follow-up. This corresponds to a cumulated incidence.  Now, let us look at the other measure which is called incidence density, denoted as ID.  The incidence density is the number of new cases divided by total person-time of observation  and that is multiplied by a factor of 10. This is also known as incidence rate. This  reflects more exactly the person-time observed.  Uses of this incidence data is, this incidence data describes trends in diseases, whether  they trend over a period of time, how the particular disease changes? And it evaluates  impact of primary prevention programs.  The dynamic of incidence and prevalence can be depicted with a diagram like this see.  There are new cases pouring in, there are cases going out because they are dying or  they are getting cured. The incidence cases are the new cases and the cases which are  remaining in the tap are the prevalence cases.  The relationship between the prevalence and incidence could be the prevalence depends  on the incidence and the duration of disease and it is denoted as prevalence is equal to  incidence into duration, P = I multiplied by D. Change in prevalence from one time period  to another may be the result of changes in the incidence rates, changes in the duration  of disease or could be both.  Now, let us look at the patterns of incidence and prevalence. High prevalence and low incidence,  there are disease like Diabetes Mellitus. Low prevalence and high incidence are the  examples are common cold.  Now, let us define a term called say the Case Fatality. In case fatality the place in relation  to the number of deaths from a disease to the number of cases, how many cases you have?  And how many of them they died? It reflects the severity of the case. This can be expressed  as a proportion or a ratio not as a rate, though its often referred to as case fatality  rate.  So, let us summarize these basic disease frequencies that we are finishing, one is the prevalence  and prevalence is a static measure taken at a point in time or over a period of time.  If you take it at a point in time it is called Point Prevalence, over a period of time it is called the Period Prevalence. Incidence is a dynamic measure taken over a certain  time and the mortality is calculated using population denominators to reflect the burden,  while the case fatality is calculated using cases as denominators to reflect severity.  These are all the measures of a disease frequency. 

## Descriptive Study Design
![[Pasted image 20220207231617.png]]
#### Types of descriptive studies
- Case reports 
- Case series
- Ecological studies
- Cross-sectional study
1. **Case reports**
    - Detailed presentation of a single case
    - New or unfamiliar diseases
    - Rare manifestations
    - Generate hypothesis regarding pathophysiological mechanism
2. Case **series**
    - Study of larger group of patients (e.g > 10) with a particular disease
    - Larger number may allow the investigator to assess the play of chance
    - Common way of delineating the clinical pictures of a disease
    - Suffers from the absence of a comparison group
3. **Ecological** studies
    - ==Group as the unit of analysis==
    - No individual-level information on the distribution of exposure and disease
    - Relate whether populations with high rates of disease also have high frequency of the suspected exposure
	- Ecological study: Trend of infectious diseases deaths in USA
	- Here the trend over time of death due to infectious diseases is related to policy or event changes in the society, but not presented at the individual level
4. **Cross sectional** surveys
    - Observation of a cross-section of a population at a single point in time
	    - Unit of observation and analysis: The individual
    - Collect information about disease burden
	    - Also known as **prevalence studies**
    - Recruitment of study participants
	    - Population
	    - Population sample
    - Observation for the presence of:
	    - One or more outcomes
	    - One or more exposures
- Uses of cross sectional surveys
    - Estimate prevalence of disease or their risk factors
    - Distribution of health problem by time, place and person
	    - Plan health care services delivery
    - Set priorities for disease control
    - Generate hypotheses
    - Examine evolving trends
	    - Before / after surveys
	    - Iterative cross sectional surveys
	- Examples of research questions to be addressed through surveys
	    - What is the prevalence of hypertension in a city?
	    - How satisfied are patients attending government hospitals in Chennai?
	    - What is the prevalence of physical inactivity among school children?
- Advantages and limitations of cross sectional survey
    - Advantages
	    - Fairly quick and easy to perform
	    - Less expensive
    - Limitations
	    - Not useful to study disease etiology
	    - Not suitable for the study of rare diseases
		- Cross sectional survey: major limitation is
		    - Prevalent cases (Old and new cases)
		    - Exposure and outcome examined at the same time. e.g.
			    - Obesity and diabetes
- Take home messages
    - Case reports and case series are useful for uncommon clinical manifestations
    - Ecological studies can be used to relate group level data and generate hypothesis
    - Cross sectional surveys help to measure the burden or magnitude of health condition

	- Welcome to this session of Health Research Fundamentals.  Today, we will be discussing about Descriptive Study Designs.  Before we go on to the descriptive study designs, let me walk you through an outline of what  are the various designs in the health research.  So, as you can see in this slide broadly, the health research studies or the epidemiological  studies can be divided into 2 categories; Descriptive studies and Analytical studies.  Further, the descriptive studies can be of 2 kinds; one is the studies which are done  for individuals and other is the studies which are done for populations.  The studies which are done for populations are called Ecological studies and there are  various types of studies that can be done at the individual level that include, Case  reports, Case series and Cross-sectional surveys.  Now, in this lecture we will not be talking about the analytical study designs which are  the other kind of studies, which will be covered in the different lectures.  Now, within analytical, the other lectures will walk you through thus observational study  designs, such as Case-control studies and Cohort studies.  Now, coming to the descriptive studies, in today’s lecture, we will be discussing about  the 4 main types of descriptive studies that are, Case reports, Case series, Ecological  studies and Cross-sectional studies.  As many of you might be working in the clinical settings or may be clinicians, you might have  come across when you read various journals, what is called as Case reports?  Some of you may also be presenting the case reports, during your clinical training as  well as in various clinical meetings and conferences.  So, what is a Case report?  Case report is nothing but a detailed presentation of a single case; what does it mean?  It means that, you may find a particular clinical manifestation or you may find some interesting  findings in your imaging, interesting findings in your lab or you may find a new kind of  manifestation of a disease, which you have never seen before and you may want to document  that and share with your peers and this is called a case report.  So, case reports are extremely useful when you want to teach others about or share your  experience with others about new diseases, unfamiliar diseases, rare manifestations,  though you have seen the disease before, but this particular type of clinical scenario  for this disease you have not come across.  These kinds of case reports may be extremely useful either to generate a hypothesis about  pathophysiological mechanism or just your fellow clinicians to be aware that they may  come across this type of clinical manifestation during their clinical practice.  As you can see here, this is an example from a journal how the case reports look like.  The case report is usually published in most of the peer reviewed journals, in a separate  section, wherein they would mention what the clinical condition is and what the particular  case report is covering.  In most of the case reports, will also talk about what is the existing evidence or what  is a literature about this and whether this type of manifestation has also been observed  by other clinicians.  Now as a case reports cover one or two patients, case series is a step ahead of that, wherein  you study a relatively larger group of patients who have a particular disease for example,  you may study 10 or more patients with some rare type of cancer or with some rare type  of tuberculosis or any other disease, how does it help you?  It helps you to understand whether these kind of findings that they are observing, are they  really due to the disease or is it due to the chance.  It may help you understand or develop what would be the clinical picture of patients  presenting with a particular type of disease.  The only problem with case series is that you don’t have a comparison group.  So, just to give you an example.  This is a very interesting case series that emerged on pneumocystis pneumonia, which was  observed in 5 gay men and this led to an understanding that, how is it that the pneumocystis pneumonia,  which is not a very common condition is actually occurring in same kind of individuals, which  subsequently led to the discovery of AIDS.  Coming to the third type of study design.  Now, this study design is slightly different.  In what way is it different?  The difference here is, here individual is not the unit of study or unit of analysis.  This is a study that you do for groups, that you can do at a country level, you can do  for populations, you can do a particular region of the country and you try to understand a  particular problem for a group and you try to relate problem as well as, what could be  the possible reason, why that problem is occurring also at the group level.  So in this type of study, group is the unit of analysis.  The limitation is that you do not have individual-level data.  You really do not know what the individual level exposure is.  However, you are able to look at a particular population let us say; we can talk about what  is an average intake of fat among people living in a state of Tamilnadu?  Or, what is the average intake of carbohydrate among people living in a particular state?  And then, you may look at what is the incidence of cardiovascular disease.  So, both the measures you only know for the population.  But you are not able to have any data at the individual level.  How does it help you?  It helps you to generate hypothesis because what you can see here is you can try to co-relate.  Let us say, is it so that the states which have high per capita consumption of fat also  have higher rates of coronary artery disease or not, if you find that then you could think  of doing a further detailed study to actually understand whether there is a correlation  between the fat intake and the cardiovascular disease.  Now, I am going to come to the most important study design and I think this is a study design  that many of you might have used in your research studies and obviously, if you are going to  be in research, you will end up using this study design for sure.  This is the commonest study design and I think you all are aware, you all are aware of census,  right?  We all have every 10 year census is done for the whole country.  Census is nothing but a cross sectional survey, what do you mean by cross sectional survey?  It is an observation of cross section of a population at a single point of time.  Now, what happens during census?  In the year 2011, somebody would have visited your house they would have come and asked  you, how many members are there in your house?  How much each person has studied?  Where do they go for work?  Where do you live?  And, this information is for year 2011; however, it may not be the same information in 2012.  So, what cross sectional survey captures is, a particular set of information that you want  to collect from a population or an individual at a particular point of time.  Now, these kind of studies are extremely useful to know the magnitude, means how big the problem  is, like if suppose if you want to know how many people in the community have high blood  pleasure?  Or how many people have tuberculosis?  Or you may even not about diseases even general information, how many people in this particular  area are actually professionals?  Any kind of information, any kind of health or non-health information, when it is collected  at a particular point of time, it is called cross sectional survey.  Now, for a cross sectional survey, you will be learning in other lectures about, what  kind of sampling method you can use?  How you can select the participants?  But, broadly speaking, census is one example of a survey which covers the entire population;  whole country is covered in this kind of survey.  However, all surveys are not done like that, most of the surveys they will select a sample.  It is not possible to survey one billion people for everything, so you might have come across  something called National Family Health Survey, wherein a sample is selected and then the  data is collected.  Similarly, if you are a clinician, you may want to plan a study in your patients in the  clinic.  However, it may not be possible for you to include all the patients in your study, and  you can think of using a sample.  A sample allows you to understand, what is the magnitude of problem in your study population  by doing survey at one point of time.  Now, here we can collect data on various type of exposure or outcome, what does it really  mean?  The exposure here means different types of risk factors for example, you may do a study,  wherein you want to know about high blood pressure; high blood pressure could be your  outcome, but in addition to that you also want to know whether people are overweight?  Whether they are having any behavioral risk factor?  Whether they smoke?  Whether they drink?  So, these are called exposures.  So, your survey may include asking questions about their history of blood pressure or doing  measurements or asking various questions about what you think are the potential exposures.  Now, what are the possible uses of cross sectional surveys?  First of all, most importantly cross sectional surveys are used to measure burden of disease  or prevalence of disease.  Let us say, out of 100 people if I am going to survey 100 people, how many actually have  high blood pleasure?  It can also be used to measure the burden of risk behaviors, you may go and survey 100  men and ask how often do you take alcohol?  What is the quantity of alcohol you consume?  So, that is a prevalence of a risk factor.  It helps you understand distribution of a health problem by time, place, person, what  does it mean?  It means, when you go and let us take, you take a particular community you went to that  area and you did a survey and you ask people, let’s say history of diarrhea, and you ask  the history of diarrhea in this village as well as in the adjacent village, you ask who  gets diarrhea and it allows you to understand how common the diseases in that particular  village; are there any particular kind of people who are effected more?  Your study might have included people from all age groups, you may have under 5 children,  you may have adolescents, you may have older people and what you can find out from this  survey is let us say, of all the people I surveyed I may find the diarrhea is more common  in children.  So, how it helps the service provider?  Cross sectional survey may provide very useful information for planning your health services,  at the bigger level.  What I mean is at the state level, at the country level or the global level.  Cross sectional surveys help us in setting priorities, for disease control.  Now, where should I invest my resources?  Which is the most important disease?  Should I invest it in a study on hypertension?  Should I invest it on a study on depression?  To understand that you need to know, what are the big health problems in your country  or in your state or whatever be the unit of study?  The cross-sectional survey allows you to measure the magnitude of the health problem.  Now, cross sectional surveys are not ideal for testing hypothesis, you will be introduced  to the analytical study designs, where you can do that; however, they help you generate  hypothesis.  You can think of what are the potential risk factors, if you find you did a study and you  found that the prevalence of hypertension is very high.  Let us say, 40 percent people have hypertension and simultaneously, you might have asked various  questions regarding their eating habits, regarding smoking, regarding alcohol use, regarding  over weight and you could do a preliminary analysis and understand whether which of these  risk factors might be playing an important role.  And this part of cross sectional survey is called analytical cross sectional survey.  However, to test your hypothesis you need to use the other study designs.  The other use of cross sectional survey is, suppose you want to know after having introduced  a particular type of intervention, it could be a clinical intervention for example, you  introduced a new drug.  A new drug into your regimen of a particular disease for example, for malaria, you are  using a particular drug or for TB.  You want to know before and after, after introducing your intervention, whether the patient outcomes  are better, you can do that using cross sectional surveys.  So, this cross sectional survey design is extremely useful design in trying to measure  the burden, understand the magnitude, understand the distribution, and sometime even to understand  the effectiveness of your interventions.  Now, these are the some of the examples of research questions that can be answered through  surveys.  What is the prevalence of hypertension or prevalence of any disease in an XY city?  The other type of study, in many time many of you might be in the health services and  you may want to do surveys to understand your patient satisfaction or you may want to even  just do a survey to know, what kind of utilization pattern is there of your health facilities?  So, you can do cross sectional survey of patients.  Many times they are also called exit surveys.  Now, thus cross sectional surveys can be done in any setting.  It could be done in schools, it could be done in health facility, it could be done at the  community level, it could be done at the clinical level.  So, another example would be that you want to know how common is the physical inactivity?  As you know, you may be interested in understanding childhood obesity and you may want to know,  what is the prevalence of physical inactivity among school children?  So, all these kind of questions can be answered using cross sectional survey study design.  Now, let us come to what are the advantages of this and what are the limitations?  Now advantage, I think you all must have realized by now, they are quick you can plan and complete  a cross sectional survey in a very short period of time; may be two weeks, one month depending  on how big your sample size is.  And, as you know I think the biggest cross sectional survey census even that is completed  in less than a year where the whole billion population is covered.  If you are doing a smaller survey they tend to be less expensive, unlike some other study  design where you may have to keep on doing data collection for much longer period of time.  There are few limitations of cross sectional survey that should be kept in mind while designing  your study.  First of all, they are not useful to study the disease etiology, as I told earlier these  are descriptive studies and here you cannot test hypothesis.  They are also not suitable in study of rare diseases, let us say if your disease, let  us say cancer; now cancer incidences 20 per 100,000 and if you want to measure the burden  of cancer, just to get those 20 cases you will have to survey 100,000 people, it is  not practical.  This kind of situation, it may not be an ideal study design.  Now, coming to the most important limitations and this you should all be very familiar and  keep in mind when you design a cross sectional survey.  Now, if you go and collect data on hypertension, there are patients who will tell you that;  yes, I have hypertension, I am taking treatment for last one year.  Now, you do the blood pressure measurement in addition to these old cases, you are also  going to pick up some of the new cases, who were not aware at the time of survey that  they have hypertension.  In a cross sectional survey, you measure all the prevalent cases, I think in the earlier  sessions you might have been introduced to these terms, terms such as prevalence, incidence.  So, cross sectional surveys measure prevalence.  Now which is fine, but what is the problem here?  Now, if you go and survey an individual and you ask, do you have hypertension?  They say, yes and then you ask them, are you a smoker?  They say, yes.  What it does not tell you?  It is the chicken and egg story, you do not know which happened first, whether hypertension  happened first or smoking happened first.  Similarly, if you take obesity and diabetes, you go in a cross sectional survey you may  find people who are diabetic as well as overweight.  How do you know which happened first?  Whether diabetes happened first or overweight happened first?  So, when you do a cross sectional survey, you need to be very cautious in interpreting  your results, you need to keep in mind that these exposure and outcome cannot be linked  very well in this kind of study design and if you want to do that, you will have to use  different kind of study designs that you will be learning in the upcoming lectures.  Now, just to summarize, case reports and case series are extremely useful to document uncommon  clinical manifestations in a certain set of patients.  And, these are extremely useful for the clinicians.  Ecological studies are useful when you want to relate a group level data and generate  hypothesis.  Cross sectional surveys, most common study design and the very useful study design, it  is useful to measure burden or magnitude of health conditions.  Thank you very much.

	- Hello and welcome.  My name is Manoj Murhekar and in today's lecture I will give you an overview of cohort and  case control studies.  In earlier lectures, my colleagues have given you an overview of different study designs.  Let us have a quick recap.  Epidemiological studies are broadly divided into 2 categories; first is Experimental studies  and second is Observational studies.  And this categorization is based on these questions; did the investigator assign the  exposure?  So, in experimental studies investigator assigns the exposure and this exposure could be in  terms of new intervention, new drug or new vaccine.  These studies are further classified into Randomized and Non-randomized studies, based  on Random allocation of exposure.  On the other hand, in observational studies investigator does not assign the exposure.  If there is no comparison group in observational studies, such studies are called as Descriptive  studies.  And in these studies, we described health event in terms of time, place and person.  If there is a comparison group in observational studies, the studies are called as analytical  studies, which are further divided based on the direction of the studies.  Cohort studies they progress from exposures to outcome, whereas case control study progress  from outcomes to exposure and in cross sectional studies we measure exposures and outcomes  at same time.  So, in short analytical studies are the one in which investigator does not assign the  exposure, there is no randomization.  So, what investigator does essentially is he carefully measures the pattern of exposure  and disease in population.  There is a comparison group in analytical studies and using this comparison group the  investigator next inferences about exposure and the disease.  Let me first talk about Cohort study.  The word cohort has a military origin, military roots rather than medical routes.  In Roman army, a 300 to 600 man unit was called as cohort, whereas in epidemiology, the word  cohort is a group of individuals sharing some common characteristic; one such example could  be a birth cohort, all the children who are born today will form today's birth cohort.  Let us see, how the design of cohort study is.  As we know, cohort study will progress from exposure of outcome and in this particular  example exposure is say, cigarette smoking and outcome development of cardio vascular  disease.  Cohort studies begin with selection of Exposed and Un-exposed cohort, and in this example,  it would be people who are the cigarette smoking and those are not smoking.  Once we identify this cohort, these cohorts are followed in time.  Some of this exposed and non-exposed individuals will develop the disease that is cardio vascular  disease, whereas the remaining people would remain non diseased.  We will then calculate the incidence of cardio-vascular disease in exposed population and in unexposed  population.  And we will compare this incidence using a measure of association called as relative  risk.  I will talk about this relative risk later.  There are 3 types of cohort studies; the first is Prospective cohorts study.  In the prospective cohort study, by the time your study starts exposure and disease has  not yet occurred.  Whereas in case of your Retrospective cohort study, both the exposures and disease has  already occurred when you start the study.  And there is a combination of these two approaches, which is called as Bidirectional study or  Ambispective study, wherein when your study starts, the exposure has already occurred  and then you follow this exposed and un-exposed individuals, till they develop the outcome.  Let me explain these different types of studies by giving some example.  First example is of Framingham heart study, which is one of the oldest cohort study initiated  in 1940s.  The objective of this study was to identify risk factors for cardio-vascular diseases.  This study was conducted in a town of Framingham, which had a population of about 28,000.  So, this population; in fact, the sample of this population was then divided into 2, based  on those having risk factor and those who was not having the risk factor.  And the investigator considered several risk factors, one of which was hypertension.  So, for the purpose they classified this population into those who had hypertension and those  who did not have hypertension.  This cohort was then followed up in time and the incidence of cardio-vascular diseases  was compared in two cohorts.  This is an example of a Retrospective cohort study.  The objective of this study was to evaluate the role of Aniline dyes or exposure to aniline  dyes and development of urinary bladder cancer.  So, the investigator for this study recruited about 4622 workers who were working in dye  industry between 1920 and 1951.  So, this recruitment was based on available records in those factories.  Investigator also reviewed the death records of this 4622 individuals and essentially,  they looked about any mention of urinary bladder tumors on their death records, and then they  compared death rates in these population with that of expected number of deaths of bladder  cancer using national statistics.  So, by the time the studies started, both exposure and outcome had occurred.  So, these are the 4 important components of cohort study.  First is selection of study population, second is gathering baseline information, third is  following up this cohort and fourth is doing analysis.  There could be 2 approaches of selecting study population.  You could select your cohort from general population as was done in case of Framingham  study or you could select a subset of general population as was done in nurses’ health  study.  The second approach could be selecting a special exposure groups, such as occupational groups.  Once you select this study population, the next important state is collecting baseline  information from this population and the objective of this step is to have a valid assessment  of exposures status of members of cohort.  And by doing this baseline information we can also collect identification details of  the study population, we can exclude those individuals, who are having the disease of  interest at baseline so that the population which remains is at risk of developing the  disease and we can also obtain the data about other risk factors or other exposure variables.  As we have seen in analytical study there is a comparison group and we have 2 options  of having comparison group in case of cohorts.  One is internal comparison group and the unexposed persons in the population is taken as an internal  comparison group and example could be Framingham cohort study.  Wherein, those who had hypertension were considered as exposed population and those who were normotensive  was unexposed population.  Sometimes it is not possible to have internal comparison group.  As we have seen in the case of aniline dye example, everybody in those factories were  exposed and it was not possible to have a internal comparison group.  And therefore, the investigators compared the death rates with that of general population,  so you could take an external comparison group in such situations.  Once you recruit your exposed and unexposed population, the next very important step is doing a good follow-up of these populations.  There could be 3 principles of having good follow-up, first is having a uniform surveillance  in exposed and unexposed group; having complete assessment of exposures and outcomes and third  is using a standardized diagnosis of outcomes, especially since the cohort studies can last  for a long period of time.  This is how the data in cohort study would look like this is how the 2 by 2 table in  cohort study would look like.  We started the study with selecting people who are exposed, which is a plusb and people  who are unexposed which is c plus d.  And we followed this people so a plus c developed the disease and b plus d remind non-diseased.  So, at the beginning of the study we know who were expose and who were not exposed.  So, we can calculate incidence of disease in exposed population which can be given by  formula a upon a plus b and incidence in unexposed population would be in c upon c plus d and  the ration of these two incidence is a relative risk.  How do you interpret this relative risk?  There could be 3 possible scenarios of relative risk, one is relative risk is equal to 1.  If your relative risk is 1, it means that incidence of disease in exposed and unexposed  population is same and we can interpret that the exposure is not associated with the disease.  Relative risk could be more than 1, which means that incidence of disease is higher  in exposed population as compared to unexposed population and we can interpret that the exposure  is positively associated with the disease.  Relative risk can also be less than 1, which means that incidence of disease in exposed  population is lower than unexposed population and here we can interpret that exposure is  negatively associated with the disease.  Cohort studies have certain strengths as well as certain weaknesses.  So, what are their strengths?  They allow calculation of incidence because when we start the study, we start the study  with selecting exposed population and unexposed population and we follow them in time therefore,  it is possible for us to calculate the incidence of disease.  We can examine multiple outcomes for a given exposures.  We are very confident about temporality in case of cohort study, and last is that this  studies are especially useful for rare exposures.  So, what are the weaknesses?  The sample size for cohort study could be very large; we need to follow these people  for a very long time and therefore, cohort studies could be expensive and time consuming.  They are not recommended for diseases which are rare or diseases which have very long  latency, and if you do not have good follow up or differential follow loss in exposed  and unexposed population it could introduce certain amount of bias in your study.  Let us now see Case control study.  Case control studies are exactly opposite to that of cohort study when it comes to the  direction or logic of the study.  Let us first see the design of cohort study.  And to explain the design, I will use the example of one of the very old case control  study conducted by Doll and Hill.  The objective of this study was to test the association between cigarette smoking and  lung cancer.  As the name suggests case control, we start with selecting cases and control is the one  who does not have the disease in question.  So, the first step is selecting cases, so for this study Doll and Hill selected lung  cancer cases, who are admitted in hospital in about 20 hospitals in London.  These cases were all histopathologically proven cases of lung cancer.  So, for each case they selected a control which was a non-lung cancer patient admitted  in the same hospital and these cases and controls are then interviewed to find out their prior  exposures.  So, Doll and Hill found out how many of the cases were cigarette smokers, they had a detailed  questionnaire to ask about history of cigarette smoking.  They asked how many of them were smoking.  What is the age of starting smoking?  What type of cigarette they were smoking?  And so on and so forth.  So, we find out how many of the cases are exposed?  How many of the controls are exposed?  And same way how many of the cases are unexposed?  And, based on this data we calculate what is called as Exposure odds among cases and  Exposure odds among controls and then we calculate what is known as odds ratio as a major of association between exposure and outcome.  Like cohorts study, there are four important elements of case control study.  First is selecting cases, second is selecting controls and third is collecting valid information  about exposures and then doing the analysis.  Coming to the selection of cases, theoretically all people in the source population who develop  the disease of interest could be included in your study or you could sample these cases.  However, one thing you should keep in mind that, the selection of cases should be independent  of exposure under study.  We need to have a clear definition of outcome to be studied.  One also need to decide whether to include prevalent cases or should include only incident  cases.  Prevalent cases mean those cases which already occurred in the past, whereas incident cases  are the newly occurring cases.  So, if you take a prevalent case they are readily available and by including them we  can save our time and money.  But, in spite of this obvious advantage it is generally recommended to include incident  cases, mainly because prevalent cases maybe related more to the survival with the disease  than the development of disease.  Where from I can select these cases?  Again, there could be two important sources; one is from hospitals or clinics, it is easier  to find cases in this hospitals and clinics; however, it is quite possible that cases which  are admitted are more severe cases and may not represent the cases in community.  The other approach could be a population based selection of cases and one such example could  be cancer registry and these cases are more likely to represent the source population,  primarily because they are not biased by factors drawing patient to a particular hospital.  Where from I can select the controls?  As I mentioned earlier, control is the one who does not have the disease under investigation.  Why do we need control?  Controls essentially represent the distribution of exposure in source population.  So, they generally tell you the background rate of exposure in the population from which  cases have come.  Like cases, they also need to be selected independent of their exposure status.  There again could be 3 sources of controls, first is the population based controls and  you could sample from general population.  Second is you could select controls from health facility and in case of Doll and Hill study  they selected control from the health facility, but we could select patient with other diseases.  And the third source of controls could be case-based controls that are from friends  or neighborhood.  Once you select cases and control, the next important step is collecting data about past  exposures.  And again, there are 3 important principles collecting the data on exposures objectively  so that your measurements are reproducible, accurately and precisely.  Once you collect the data on exposures, this is how your 2 by 2 table will look like.  This is exactly the same table which we saw for the cohort study.  However, in case control studies, when the study started we knew who were case and we  knew who were controls.  So, a plus c, were cases to start with and b plus d were the controls.  And we found out that of the a plus c cases, a were exposed and c were unexposed and same  way b plus d controls b were exposed and d were unexposed.  In case control study we cannot calculate incidence of disease, like what we could calculate  in case of cohort studies.  So, what do we do?  Then what we do is, essentially we calculate a measure of association called Odds ratio.  This odds ratio is the odds that cases was exposed is given by this formula; probability  that case was exposed, upon probability that case was not exposed.  And we know that probability a case was exposed is a upon a plus c and probability that the  case was not exposed is c upon a plus c and the ration of these 2 probabilities is a by  c.  Same way we also calculate the odds that control was exposed, which comes out to be b by d  and the ratio of these 2 odds becomes odds ratio which is ab by bc, which is nothing  but a gross product ratio.  How to interpret this odds ratio?  Again like relative risk there could be 3 scenarios, one is odds ratio equal to 1.  If odds ratio is equal is to 1, it means that odds of exposure among cases and controls  are same and we can conclude that exposure is not associated with disease in such situation.  Odds ratio could be more than 1, it means that your odds of exposure among cases are  higher than that of controls and we can conclude that exposure is positively associated with  the disease.  If odds ratio is less than 1, it means that odds of exposure are among cases are lower  than that of controls and we can conclude that exposure is negatively associated with  the disease.  Case control study also has certain strengths and weaknesses.  These studies are especially good, if the outcome is rare or the diseases have the long  latency period.  They are fairly easy or quick to conduct and hence inexpensive.  Requires relatively less subjects than that of cohort studies and multiple exposures or  risk factors can be examined at the same time.  The weaknesses of cohort study include that they are susceptible to several biases, the  recall bias one of the most important bias.  Sometime selection of control could be a problem, selection of an appropriate comparison group  may be difficult and we cannot calculate incidence or disease in these studies.
## Experimental study designs: Clinical trials
- ( )
	- ![[Pasted image 20220209204756.png]]
- Significance of clinical trials
    - Clinical trials translate results of basic scientific research into better ways to prevent, diagnose, or treat disease
    - Research studies involving people are designed to answer scientific questions and find better ways to prevent, diagnose, or treat disease
- **Randomized controlled clinical trials**
    - A clinical trial is a planned experiment designed to assess the efficacy of prophylactic / diagnostic / therapeutic agents, devices, regimens, procedures etc. applied to human subjects
    - It essentially involves comparing the outcomes in a group of patients treated with a test treatment with those observed in a comparable group of patients receiving a control treatment where patients in both groups are enrolled in a prospective study, treated or exposed to intervention and followed over the same period
- The objectives of clinical trials --> Clinical trials are normally conducted to evaluate new forms of therapy or prevention methods such as
    - New drugs/ treatment
    - New medical / health care technology
    - New organization/ delivery system of health care
    - New methods of primary prevention
    - New programs of screening or early detection
- Clinical trail
	- ![[Pasted image 20220209213843.png]], ![[Pasted image 20220209213938.png]], 
- Randomization
	- Randomization ensures that participants have an equal chance to be assigned to one of two or more groups:
	A. One group gets the most widely accepted treatment (standard treatment/ gold standard)
	B. The other gets the new treatment being tested, which researchers hope and have reason to believe will be better than the standard treatment
	- Randomization provides the best way to prove the effectiveness of a new agent or intervention by ensuring that
	A. All groups are as similar as possible
	B. Confounding, co-interventions and bias in outcome ascertainment is minmized
- Blinding in clinical trials helps in balancing groups during follow-up
    - Blinding can be at the level of
	    - participants [single blinding]
	    - Participants and investigators [double blinding] and
	    - Participants, investigators and analysts [triple blinding]
    - Blinding helps to eliminate
	    - Co-intervention: participants use other therapy or change behavior or study staff, medical providers, family or friends treat participants differently
	    - Biased outcome ascertainment: participants may report symptoms or outcomes differently or physicians or investigators may elicit symptoms or outcomes differently
- Phases in clinical trials and objectives 
	- ![[Pasted image 20220209214450.png]]
- Example of a therapeutic trial
	- To study if a new drug regimen [NDR] effectively lowers viral load and improves CD4 counts in HIV infected persons compared to standard therapy [HAART]
	 1. Identify HIV infected persons, define inclusion and exclusion criteria
	 2. Randomize patients into 2 groups, one receives NDR, the other HAART
	 3. Follow-up periodically, estimate viral load and CD4 counts periodically
	 4. Use statistical methods to see if there are differences between viral load and CD4 counts in the two groups
- Example of a Prevention trial
	- A new vaccine candidate has been developed that has generated laboratory and animal data supporting its safety and ability to generate immune response. It is being considered a promising candidate for humans
	 1. Decide at the national, regional and local level whether this vaccine is appropriate for the country and the population
	 2. Develop a Phase I trial design
	 3. Find healthy volunteers [adults/ children, men/ women]
	 4. Carry out screening followed by enrollment: Randomize patients into 2 groups, one receives vaccine, the other placebo
	 5. Follow-up the participants periodically, record safety and estimate immunogenicity periodically
	 6. Use statistical methods to establish safety and immunogenicity periodically
- Advantages & Disadvantages of RCTs
	- Advantages
	    - The only effective method known to control selection bias
	    - Controls confounding bias without adjustment
	    - Facilitates effective blinding in some trials
	    - Maintains advantages of cohort studies
	- Disadvantages
	    - May be complex and expensive
	    - Lack representativeness � volunteers differ from population of interest
	    - Ethical challenges are immense

	- In the course of Health Research Fundamentals, today I am going to discuss the Experimental  study designs or Clinical trials.  As has been discussed earlier, the various types of epidemiological study designs are  classically described as observational designs and experimental study designs.  Observational study design is where the exposure is not manipulated by the investigators and  there are two different types of observational studies.  There could be descriptive studies like a series cross sectional studies or ecological  studies and analytical studies include case controls studies, which are retrospective  in nature and cohort studies, which are prospective in nature.  But, considered as more advanced are the experimental study designs, where the exposure is manipulated  by the investigator and a classical example of this is clinical trials.  . These clinical trials, these kinds of studies  were one of the main scientific advances in the last century, they are considered as the  methodological standard of excellence, are also described as gold standard for scientific  experiments.  Their main significance is that they are essential for translating the results of basic scientific  research into better ways to either prevent the disease, diagnose a disease or a condition  or to treat a particular disease and they have a huge translational value.  But, primarily randomized controlled clinical trials and we are going to discuss this at  length today.  These are planned experiments, primarily designed to assess the efficacy of prophylactic, diagnostic  or therapeutic agents.  It also helps to test out the new devices or different types of drug regimens or new  procedures that are being introduced including the investigative procedures, etcetera, particularly  in human subjects.  Basically, it involves comparing the outcomes in two groups of individuals and when we talk  about doing a therapeutic trial, we talk about people suffering from a particular disease,  who are grouped into two different groups.  Wherein, one group requires a new kind of a treatment and the other group requires the  standard treatment that is being available at that point of time.  Then, what is done is over a period of time, they are evaluated, which we call it as a  prospective study and we find out how many of them get effectively cured for example.  So, this is the prospective nature of the study, all the participants are essentially  followed for a certain period of time and that is why it is a planned experiment.  Why?  Because here is where, as we have discussed earlier in the definition, the environment  has been modified, manipulated or modified by the investigator because the investigator  has decided that some people will be placed in one particular arm of the clinical trial,  wherein the other group will be placed in the other arm of the clinical trial and that  is what is the process called randomization, which we will be discussing sometime later.  Clinical trials can be broadly used for a variety of reasons as we briefly discussed.  New drugs, new treatments, new medical or health care technologies, new organizational  or delivery systems of health care, new methods of primary prevention or new programs for  screening of early detection of diseases.  They could be employed in a variety of scenario.  Normally, clinical trials are equated with drugs and pharmaceuticals.  So, this essentially have intent of therapeutic benefit.  So, if we just think about how this could be done is?  We have a large number of individuals, who are actually suffering from a particular disease.  What we do here is?  We take out a sample of people, who are, say eligible to apply eligible to, say participate  in a clinical trial.  Here is where the problem is, that these are the people who should be willing to participant  in the study.  So, we cannot say that, this particular sample is essentially generalized or it is generally  representative of the total population that we are dealing with.  Now, in a process of randomization, which we will talk about they will be sent out to  two different arms of the clinical trials.  Whereas, one arm will receive the new treatment or one type of treatment, whereas the other  arm will receive the standard old treatment or the second type of treatment.  Then all these individuals will be prospectively followed up for a defined duration and with  a defined frequency.  Maybe it is 1 year, once in every 3 months or 2 years, once in every 6 months or whatever  and then we assess them again to find out because it is a therapeutic trial.  What we want to figure out is how many of them have actually got cured of the disease?  And how many continue to have the disease?  The reason why we are testing out a new treatment, we are having an expectation that the newer  treatment will have more benefit.  So, the number of people being cured of this particular disease would be more compared  to that in the other arm and this can be statistically analyzed.  In case of a prevention scenario, say if we talk of new vaccine for example, this can  also be tested in a clinical trial design.  Here, the type of population will obviously change.  Here, we will talk of people or the population, which is susceptible or at risk of developing  that particular disease.  Here, again we will take out a sample of people who are willing to participate in the study.  Like in the therapeutic trial, these will be randomized into two arms, one arm or one  group of people in them will receive the vaccine and the other will receive a placebo.  This is a critical decision which needs to be really discussed at length, whether it  is a placebo or some other type of a vaccine or what can be given in this particular scenario  as a comparator arm.  Again, these two groups of individuals are followed for a certain period of time with  a certain periodicity and what we try to judge is how many of them in either of the two arms  actually acquire the disease?  The expectation is that if the vaccine is effective, less number of people in that particular  arm who are receiving the vaccine would acquire the disease compared to those who have not  received the vaccine in the comparator arm or the placebo arm.  This can also be statistically analyzed and so we decide, whether this particular vaccine  has been effective in preventing occurrence of that particular disease in susceptible  populations.  The most critical step in a clinical trial is what we call as randomization.  Randomization is a process, where we say that the participants have an equal chance of being  assigned to any study group.  There may be one study group, there may be two arms in the trial and there may be multiple  arms in the trial.  Accordingly, the original numbers of participants that are found eligible that get placed into  various arms in a pre-decided manner.  In the number, in each arm is decided and candidates get assigned or the participants  get assigned to different kinds of arms here.  What is important here is, the participants do not decide that he or she or they want  to participant in a particular arm.  It is done through a neutral process.  Also, the investigators do not decide, whether a particular participant goes in arm A or  arm B or arm 1 or arm 2.  It is a process of randomization, which is a third party procedure which decides that.  So, one group gets the most widely accepted treatment, which we call it as the standard  treatment or the gold treatment.  Whereas, the other group gets the new treatment and here, the hope and expectation is that  the newer treatment is better than the standard treatment.  This is the process of randomization.  So, it ensures that we can test the effectiveness of new agent optimally here because all groups  are most likely to be similar, as similar as possible and confounding, co-interventions  and bias in outcome ascertainment can be minimized.  Similarly, blinding is another quality improvement technique, which is often used in clinical  trials and blinding is a procedure when participants, if they do not know, what they are getting,  whether they are getting drug a or drug b?  This is called single blinding that is here participants are not aware as to what kind  of drug is being given to them, investigators may be aware.  Sometimes participants as well as investigators do not know what kind of drug allocation is  being done because the type of treatments that are been given, the nature, the color  and the appearance of the interventions is exactly identical.  This is a double blinding procedure and even when the analysts also are kept blinded, while  they analyze the results, this is called as triple blinding.  Basically, this stepwise blinding from single to double to triple blinding that eliminates  the kind of subjectivity in judgment of outcomes in a large number of instances.  There are two problems that generally arise, one is a co-intervention.  What happen is participant, if they realize that one particular group is getting a particular  type of drug, the other group is getting the other type of drug.  They try to do some kind of an exchange and decide something between themselves.  Sometimes, this is also facilitated by some kind of study staff or medical providers or  family or friends, etcetera and hence this kind of a co-intervention that takes place  can vitiate the results of the study and hence blinding helps to eliminate that.  Also, if for example, if a patient or a study participant knows what he is getting, if he  is getting a new drug, may be some of the minor elements he might want to exaggerate  as compared to the, if he knows that he is getting the standard treatment, he may not  want to report that.  Similar thing may happen in case of those, who are actually evaluating that study participant  and hence these kinds of biases in outcome ascertainment that can come in, can be minimized  in blinding.  Typically, all the clinical trials are done in 4 phases.  The phase I, is the step 1 in clinical evaluation of any new intervention that comes in and  here is where the trial is done in a very small number of individuals, generally below  50 and they are mostly the healthy volunteers, who are the part of phase I study and goal  is to do safety and acceptability evaluation here.  When this particular product is found to be safe and acceptable, it passes on to the phase  II trial, which is generally done in larger number of individuals, generally 100 to 500  and who may be having some kind of low risk of a particular disease and here is where  we studied the long-term safety.  We also try to study the dose and schedule, in case of a vaccine for example or in case  of a vaccine again some early indications of efficacy.  This is a phase II design.  A phase III design, essentially is a large trial, which looks at the efficacy of a particular  intervention and under controlled clinical conditions, generally they involve thousands  of individuals and who are more at risk of acquiring that particular disease or who are  suffering from that particular disease and we try to look at in a therapeutic scenario,  how that particular drug is effective in curing or in prevention scenario how that particular  prevention measure is helpful in preventing the occurrence of that particular disease.  Once, all these phases I, II and III are completed, the product goes for licensures in the country,  it gets a license and once it gets the license, it gets marketed in the country and then phase  IV trials are undertaken, which are considered as post-marketing surveillance and they are  done in again thousands and thousands of individuals, but it is generally collection of information  in a community based manner not in a thorough clinical kind of a clinical trials set up.  This is how clinical trials are conducted.  Just, I will give you an example of a therapeutic trial.  If you want to study a new drug regimen, whether it can effectively lower the viral load and  it also results in an improvement in the CD4 counts in HIV infected persons.  So, I am talking about HIV AIDS scenario, where people are eligible for treatment.  Now, currently there is a standard HAART, Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy; which  is available, which comprises of 3 drugs, which is being given at ART centers, Antiretroviral  Therapy centers, which are run by the government in our country, all of us know that.  Somebody comes up with the new drug regimen, which probably is a cheaper regimen.  Probably where the number of tablets required are much smaller than the standard HAART regimen  and so, one wants to evaluate whether this is an optimum regimen to be used in the country  or not.  So, how would we go about it?  We will identify HIV infected individuals and define the inclusion and exclusion criteria  for participation, whether they are eligible to be put on antiretroviral therapy.  Then they will be randomized, all those who are found to be eligible in screening will  be randomized into two groups or arms.  One will receive the new drugs regimen, the other will receive the gold standard that  is available now; which is the highly active antiretroviral therapy will follow them up  periodically.  The expectation will be both these sets of drugs will effectively lower the viral load  and help to improve the CD4 counts.  This will be evaluated periodically, once in every 6 months for example and if the total  period of study is 1 year or 2 years, we just see, how these two groups have reacted or  responded to these two different types of the regimens and statically we will try to  find an answer, whether this new therapy that we are talking about has provided any kind  of an additional benefit.  This can be done using standard statistical methods.  In case of a prevention trial, new vaccine candidate has been developed and there is  a generally data available in the laboratory, also in the animal studies which you have,  which support that, it is a safe vaccine candidate and it is able to generate some kind of a  immune response against a particular disease and it is felt that it can be used as a candidate  in humans for prevention against that particular disease.  So, how we will go about this particular thing is, first is essentially to decide at the  national, regional or local level, whether this vaccine is appropriate for the country  and whether we want to evaluate this or not.  Then develop a phase I trial design, here is where because we are talking about a phase  I study now.  A new vaccine is being developed; we have to start with a phase I trial design.  We will have to find healthy adult volunteers, then depends on what type of vaccinate it  is.  If it is a primarily a disease in children, sometimes children could also be recruited  in the study.  With then, we carry out screening to find out whether, who are the people who are willing  to participate in the study are actually eligible for enrollment and then we randomize them  into two groups.  One group will receive the vaccine, the other will receive the placebo and then we will  follow them up to find out the safety, how will the safety be evaluated?  We will see what kind of reactions are occurring immediately and in the long run, say for a  period one to one and half years.  What kind of adverse events are reported in both these kinds of individuals and then try  to compare between the people who are receiving vaccine verses those who are receiving the  placebos.  Also, we will do some blood test, to find out what kind of immunogenic response has  been stimulated in either as these two groups and compare them using standard statistical  methods.  So, that is an example of a prevention trial.  So, even if there are impediments here, the clinical trials are the only way for making  a progress in medical science because, if there are no clinical trials, no new drugs  will come.  If there are no clinical trials, no new technologies will be tested, no new vaccines will be tested  and so they must be supported and the adequate information about clinical trials must be  disseminated.  The advantages of a clinical trial include that this is the only effective method known  to control the selection bias of participants.  Also, it controls confounding bias without any adjustment, facilitates effective blinding  in some trials and maintains advantages of cohort study or a prospective study, but there  are certain disadvantages of this.  It is a very complex procedure, it requires thorough training of all the investigators  and also any clinical trial is very expensive.  As I mentioned earlier, we essentially use a sample from the total population that is  eligible to participate in the trial and hence, there is some level of problem with respect  to generalizability of this particular finding.  But, that is something which one has to accept and there are ethical challenges which are  immense.  So, we know that this is a difficult study to do, but we also know that progress will  essentially be made if we have new drugs, if we have new therapies, if we have new technologies  and if we have new interventions.  Thank you for your attention.
## Validity of epidemiological studies
- OBJECTIVES OF EPIDEMIOLOGICAL STUDIES
	- To obtain an *accurate estimate* of disease frequency and effect of exposure on health outcomes in study population -> **Internal validity**
	- To obtain an estimate that is *generalizable* to relevant target populations --> **External validity**

	    - Admission to health care facilities - Systematic admission of:
		    - Case-patients exposed / unexposed
		    - Control-subjects exposed / unexposed
	    - Selective survival - Systematic inclusion of cases who survived and who may be more or less exposed
	    - Non response / loss to follow up - Systematic inclusion of subjects more likely to participate who may be:
		    - More or less exposed
		    - More or less at risk
	- **Dealing with selection bias** by
		1. While *Designing stage* of a study
		    - Use incident cases, not prevalent cases
		    - Case control studies more prone for this bias so
			    - Use population-based design
			    - Apply same eligibility criteria for selecting cases and controls
			    - Both cases and controls undergo the same diagnostic procedures and intensity of disease surveillance
		2. At *Data collection stage* of the study by
		    - Minimize nonresponse, nonparticipation and loss to follow-up (Cohort studies)
		    - Keep a record of all losses and collect baseline data on them
		    - Make sure that diagnosis of disease is not affected by exposure status (by blinding)
		3. At *Analysis stage* of study
		    - Compare non-responders/dropouts with responders/non-dropouts with respect to baseline variables
			    - Large differences strongly suggest selection bias
			    - Small differences do not rule out selection bias
		    - Use study results and external information to deduce the direction of biases and assess magnitude of biases
			    - Do sensitivity analysis
- **Information bias** 
	- Do measurements accurately represent phenomena of interest? 
		- Bias results from procedures used to measure exposures, outcomes and other variables
	- Information bias in epidemiological studies can happen in
	    - Case control study via

	- Today, we are going to talk about Validity in Epidemiological Studies.  What if you come across one day, a headline in the newspaper that a study says, that coffee  drinking doubles the risk of heart attack?  What is going to be your reaction?  In order to further go into indepth into the study, we will actually need to look at how  the study was done?  And how valid are the results of the study?  If you look at any epidemiological study, the basic goal of any epidemiological study  is twofold; one is to obtain an accurate estimate of whatever is being studied, whether that  is the frequency of a disease or the effect of an exposure on a health outcome.  And all of this, we study in a certain sample of the population.  Now, this aspect of any epidemiological study is known as internal validity of the study.  How valid are the method that are being used to either estimate the frequency or determine  the effect of an exposure?  Now, in the long run what we would want is we would want that this estimate is generalizable  to the relevant target populations among which the study is being done.  Now, this aspect of any epidemiological study is known as external validity, so that the  results of the study can be extrapolated to the whole population.  When we talk of accuracy of the estimate, what accuracy actually means, it consists  of two things, precision and validity.  If we look at say, a bullÕs eye and we want to hit the mark, what we would want to be,  is to be precise and as well as valid, so that we try to hit the bulls mark as many  as times as possible.  So, similarly every epidemiological study can have results, which are both precise and  valid, which is what we would actually want in every study.  However, there could be studies, where the results may be precise which means that every  time the study has been done you get the similar results, but it may be that the methodology  was not correct and so they are not valid.  It may happen that the results are not precise, but sometimes they may be valid or in the  worst-case scenario, either result may be neither precise nor valid.  So, when we are looking at any epidemiological study, we need to be wary of both precision  as well as validity.  As I told you in epidemiological studies all that we are doing is, basically estimating.  We are estimating, either the frequency of a disease or a health outcome or we are estimating  what is the effect of an exposure on an outcome?  Now, when we are doing these estimations there are bound to be errors that may happen in  our studies.  There are two kinds of errors that we come across when we are doing epidemiological studies.  One are called random errors or errors that happen due to chance, which is basically the  variability because of any unknown or uncontrollable causes such as errors in sampling or errors  in doing measurements.  However, the more problematic error that we may face in any study, are called systematic  errors or biases.  These are the errors that are basically a threat to validity of any epidemiological  study.  And, how do these errors happen in any study?  Basically, the way we do the study, the methodology that we use to do an epidemiological study  and if it is done in a certain way that tends to produce results, that are not the true  results, then that leads to errors which are called biases.  Ultimately, what we would see is that, either the estimates or the associations that we  are trying to assess between the exposure and the outcome in the study sample may defer  from the true causal associations between the same exposure and outcome that may be  there in the source population.  So, let us look at the various kinds of biases or Threats to validity in epidemiological  studies.  There are essentially three kinds of biases that may occur in epidemiological study.  These are called as selection bias, information bias and confounding.  So, let us go through one by one.  Coming to selection bias, selection bias happens when we use procedures to select populations.  Remember that, in epidemiological study we are sampling a certain number of individuals  to participate in the study.  The way, in which we select the study participants, are we sure that these study participants  really accurately represent the target population?  And if there is any issue in which, the way we select these people that results into what  we call as selection bias.  Now, how do all these things happen in epidemiological studies?  Remember that, we are selecting our cases and controls and these may happen through  either, we are using a surveillance mechanisms from which there is a systematic notification  of cases and if we are taking more of exposed cases from this surveillance mechanisms that  could be one way in which selection bias could occur.  We will be screening and doing diagnosis more systematically among those, who are exposed.  If we know their exposure history before hand and then that can artificially create biases.  Again, selection biases can occur in, if we select our cases and controls from health  care facilitiesÉhospitals and where if, it is likely that more of the case patients who  are exposed are admitted or the other way round that can lead to selection bias.  Another common way in which selection bias occurs is, when we select those cases who  are alive, the cases of the disease who are dead would not be part of our studies and  it may be that, the reason why these cases are alive, may have to do with the exposure  status and hence, selective selection of survived patients can actually lead to selection bias.  In cohort studies, selection bias usually occurs when there is a lost to followup.  Remember that, we have to follow up people over a period of time in cohort studies and  if it is likely that people, who are less exposed or more exposed, are more likely to  be lost or people who are at more risk or at lesser risk are more likely to be lost  to follow up, that eventually can lead to results that are biased and that would be  attributable to selection bias.  How do we deal with selection bias?  We can deal with selection bias at any stage of our study.  Ideally, we would want to make sure that the way in which we design the study is free from  selection bias.  So, one way would be to use incident cases and not prevalent cases because prevalent  cases have the issue of survival bias.  Especially, case control studies are more prone to this, to selection bias and various  ways in which, to deal with selection bias in case control studies is to use population  based design rather than hospital based design, such that the cases and controls are actually  selected from the community or the population and not from few or a particular health care  facilities.  We need to make sure that we apply the same eligible criteria, when we are selecting cases  and controls and we are not leaning towards a particular exposure among the cases and  controls.  Again, both the cases and controls should undergo the same diagnostic procedures and  the same intensity of surveillance in order to identify them as cases and controls.  So, that we are not biased at the time of their selection.  Now, at the time of data collection what we need to ensure is to minimize non-response,  to minimize non-participation and make sure that we do not lose many people, especially  in cohort studies over a long follow-up period.  Even if, we should anticipate actually that we may lose people and so it would be a good  idea to actually keep a record of all these losses, at least some basic socio demographic  characteristics of these people.  So, that later on, at the analysis stage, we can actually compare people who were lost  to follow up versus those who remain in the study and see if there were any major differences  in these two populations, which could lead to selection bias.  We also need to make sure at the time of data collection that the diagnosis of disease is  not affected by the exposure status, which means at the time of selecting, who the cases  and controls are, the person who is selecting the cases and controls should not be aware  of what the exposures status of this population, of the cases and controls are and this one  way in which we do, this is called blinding.  Now, even at the analysis stage, what we can do is, as I told you before, we can compare  those who responded or those who did not respond.  Those who are dropouts compared to those who are left in the study with respect to the  base line variables and see if there are any large or small difference between these two  groups.  If we find large differences, it is suggestive of selection bias; however, small differences  do not rule out selection bias.  So, we need to be wary of that.  Again, another way to assess whether there may be a selection bias may have occurred  in our study, is to do what we call as sensitivity analysis, in which we try to do an analysis  assuming how much bias could have happened, and what direction it could have gone and  try to see how it affects the study results.  If the study results are affected in a major way then we can assume that, yes selection  bias has occurred.  Moving on to the next threat to validity and that is called information bias.  Information bias is essentially a bias that can occur when we are measuring the characteristics  of study participants.  Now, what do we measure, we measure exposures, we measure outcomes and we measure other variables  which may influence the exposures and the outcomes, which are called as third factors  or confounders or modifiers.  What we need to make sure that the measurements that we are doing accurately, represent what  it actually is, the level of exposure is accurately measured whether there is an outcome present  or absent is accurately measured and other variables, such as socio demographic, age,  gender, education, income all those variables are also appropriately measured.  Now, how does this happen?  In case control studies, information bias can happen if we are collecting exposure information  which is leaning towards a particular exposure status, if we are trying to collect more of  people, who are exposed compared to the unexposed or the other way round.  This can lead to information bias.  One of the very common ways in which information bias occurs in case control studies is through  the process of recall.  Remember, that we have cases and controls and we are trying to, we are asking them to  recall the past history of exposures and it may be, it may so happen that those people  who are diseased or who have a certain health event may be more likely to recall certain  exposures compared to those people who are healthy and this is what we call as recall  bias.  It may also be possible that better exposure data is available on cases compared to the  controls and that again can lead to information bias.  In cohort studies, information bias can happen, if we collect information leaning towards  a specific outcome status.  If we follow the exposed population much more rigorously compared to the unexposed population,  that is something that can lead to information bias in cohort studies.  It may also be possible that better outcome data is available among the exposed and then  again compared to the unexposed, which can again produce information bias in the study.  Information bias can be introduced in a study both, either by what the investigator does  in the way in which the investigators collect the information about the cases, about the  controls, about the exposure, about whether they get the disease or not get the disease  and if there is a systematic way in which this is being done irregularly that can lead  to information bias and last, but not the least, of course, remember that in general,  in observational epidemiological studies, we are dependent on what our study participants  tell us and if there is any systematic distortion of the true facts by the study participants,  that is anyways going to lead to information bias.  Now, how do we deal with information bias?  First of all because we are measuring the exposure variable, the outcome variable and  the other variables, we need to set up precise operational definitions of what we are going  to measure and how much is it going to be.  We need to have detailed measurement protocols in the way we are going to measure each of  these variables.  Sometimes, it is also good way to do repeated measurements on key variables say, for example,  blood pressure and we know that blood pressure can vary from time to time.  So, we may take more than one readings of blood pressure and then take an average of  that reading, in order to say, what the actual blood pressure of that individual is at that  particular point of time.  It is very important, that the investigators are trained and certified in the way in which  they follow the study protocol and all the methodology that needs to be done to collect  information.  There we can do data audits, both of the interviewers and of course, of the data management centers  where the data is stored to, in order to make sure that the way in which the data is collected,  the data is retrieved, the data is stored is done correctly and there is no information  bias happening because of the same.  Once, the data is collected, we need to make sure that the data is clean.  We need to go through the data both visually as well as through computer programs, softwares  and make sure that we getting clean data.  It is also good practice to actually rerun all your analysis before you are trying to  do give say, send your paper for publication, just to make sure that there is no possibility  of any information bias occurring because of the way the analysis was done.  Now, we are going to look at the next threat to validity, which is called confounding.  Confounding comes from a French word, which actually means confusion of effects.  Now, what effects are we talking about here?, remember what we are doing in epidemiological  study is looking at the effect of an exposure on the outcome, whether if you are more exposed  are you more likely to get the disease or vice versa.  Now, what we want to know is the effect of this exposure on a particular outcome.  This effect can be confused with the effect of a third factor, which can have an influence  both on the outcome as well as the exposure and this is what leads to the phenomenon of  what is called confounding.  Now, what does confounding do?  Actually, confounding is probably the most, the biggest threat to validity in any epidemiological  study because confounding can actually simulate, can show you an association even when it does  not exist.  Confounding may hide associations that is actually there or confounding may actually  increase or decrease the strength of the association.  So, you may say that an exposure is more associated with the outcome or less associated with the  outcome than what it actually is, and in the worst case scenario, confounding can actually  change the direction of an effect.  If an exposure, say, causes an outcome, because of confounding you may see that the exposure  is preventing the occurrence of that outcome and that is the most dangerous threat to validity  in any epidemiological study.  So, how does confounding happen?  So, diagrammatically what we represent that confounder is a third factor, is a variable,  which influences both the exposure and the outcome and when we are trying to determine  what is the association between the exposure and outcome, this association is influenced  by this third factor.  Now, we can deal with confounding, both at the design stage and at the analysis stage.  It is always better to deal with it at the design stage than to take care of it at the  analysis stage.  So, at the design stage, we can do several things.  One, we can do what is called restriction; we can restrict our study participants to  only those people who are in one stratum of the confounders, so that the confounders cannot  play a role in the association between exposure and outcome.  Secondly, we can do, what is called matching.  If we already know what the potential confounders could be in a particular study we can match  our cases and controls on those particular confounders and which will negate the effect  of the confounders and then the association that we see between the exposure and outcomes  would be without the influence of the confounders.  Of course, remember that, if you do matching you have to do what is called matched analysis.  In experimental studies, we do what is called randomization and that is something that actually  automatically takes care of the confounders and makes sure that the two arms in a randomized  trials are similar in all ways in terms of the confounding variable.  Now, at the time of analysis, what we need to do in every study, is to actually first  test whether there is any confounding or whether there are variables, which could be acting  as confounders, which need to be taken care of at the time of analysis and this is where  we do what is called stratified analysis.  And we stratify our data in various stratum of the confounder, and then try to find associations  and which helps us to identify whether there is confounding or not.  Now, in order to take care of these confounders, we can do, what is called a multivariate analysis,  where in we do, we use regression techniques, whether it is logistic regression, linear  regression or other advanced methodologies in order to take into account the effect of  confounding and then the associations that we get between the exposure and outcome are  without the influence of the confounder or as we say adjusted for the confounders.  So, how do you evaluate associations?  Whenever you see a study, whenever you see a risk ratio or an odds ratio, what you see  is a crude association.  Now, how do we make sure that this crude association is actually the true or the causal association,  that is the true relationship between the exposure and the outcome?  What we need to make sure is, we need to go through this spiral.  We need to make sure that it is not because of chance.  We need to ensure that there is no selection bias.  We need to check if there could be any information bias.  We need to understand if there could be confounding and if that confounding has been taken care  of.  Only after going through this process, we would be able to say that whether the crude  association is actually the casual association or not.  So, coming back to our problem, does coffee really increase the risk of heart attack?  Well, let us analysis this.  What we wanted to do is to look at all population, all adults in the population, who are drinking  coffee.  Now, in the study what we get is a sample of people who agreed to take part in the study.  Now, these people could be people who are more likely to drink coffee or less likely  to drink coffee.  These people, may be hospitalized patients, and if you are doing a study in a hospital  and it maybe that these patients are hospitalized for say, gastric ulcer and that is because  of coffee drinking.  So, the way in which we select these participants can actually lead to a bias and that is what  is called selection bias.  Now, what are the exposures that we are trying to assess here, is the coffee, actual coffee  intake of the study participants and what we get from the study participants is actually  what they report?  Are they reporting the true coffee intake?  Do they actually remember how many cups of coffee they have had in the past?  What is the average number of coffee they drink?  Whether they drink coffee with milk, without milk?  What is the strength of the coffee?  All of these issues can actually influence whether the coffee intake that we are measuring  is actually the true coffee intake and that can lead to information bias.  Again, remember that we are also trying to see whether the people really had a heart  attack or not and it is possible that they maybe have may have been a misdiagnosis of  a heart attack.  There could be other, the chest pain that the study participants may report as heart  attack, may actually have been may be due to other causes and that is reported as heart  attack.  So, actually what we may be seeing is not heart attack, but some other causes for chest  pain and that is again the study results would then be influenced by information bias.  Then of course, there is confounding.  Could it be that this association that we saw between coffee and heart attack, what  we call myocardial infarction in medical terminology, could it be confounded by smoking?  Is it possible that , we know that those who are smokers are more likely to, is a known  risk factor for heart attack.  It is also known that those who are smokers are more likely to be coffee drinkers and  it is possible that because we may see more of smokers among the coffee drinkers and more  of smokers among those who had an heart attack the association that we are seeing between  coffee and heart attack is not due to the actual coffee, but it is actually because  of the effect of smoking on heart attack.  So, the result of this association between coffee and MI could have just been confounded  by the effect of smoking.  What we need to understand is that, there are various threats to validity in any epidemiological  study and these biases can occur in all epidemiological studies, more so in observational studies,  such as case control and cohort study and less so, in randomized trials.  Biases can occur during all stages of the study, when we are designing the study, if  the study is not designed appropriately, if the study is not conducted appropriately or  if the analysis is not done appropriately, all of which can lead to one or the other  biases.  And we know that biases threaten both the internal and external validity.  Remember that, the study which has no internal validity cannot be generalized and so it does  not have any external validity.  So, we need to keep in mind is that, when we are designing a research study, we need  to be thinking of all the possible ways in which these various biases could creep-in  into our study and design it appropriately and try to prevent as many biases as possible  at the time of designing and implementing the study.  However, we should also remember that, there could be some biases which cannot be avoided.  What we need to understand is at the time of analysis of the results, we need to be  aware of what these biases could have been and state these biases in the form of limitations  of the study.  So, it is critical that whenever we look at the results of any epidemiological study,  we need to be wary of what possible threats could be to the validity of these studies  and make sure that the investigators have taken care of these various threats.

	- Today, I am going to give you a glimpse of another method of research and what we generallycall as Qualitative Research Methods.I am going to give you a snap-shot of what these methods are.In the paradigm of health research or any research for that matter, we generally dividemethods into quantitative and qualitative.Qualitative methods generally find their origin in the Science of Anthropology, Sociology,and Psychology, wherein which is more about dealing with human beings understanding theirbehaviors.When we look, sort of try to compare the quantitative with the qualitative methods some of the basicdifference is that you would see is that the qualitative is always concerned with words,with text.So the data that we get in qualitative methods is actually text and not necessarily numbersthat you usually see in quantitative.In qualitative research, what we try to do is to interpret the social reality more fromthe participants’ point of view and their experience rather than measuring it objectivelyfrom the investigators’ experience.So, this is what is known as the emic perspective.In terms of the logic of inquiry, again, qualitative methods are more inductive and they are usedin the way to understand the processes that are derived from the data compared to thequantitative methods, wherein which is more deductive and where we try to test our formalhypothesis using the data.In terms of the research design, qualitative methods are mostly about interpreting theresponses of the participants, rather than trying to see whether what they are sayingis what the investigator feels.Whereas, quantitative methods ensure repeatability of the data and the methods are such thatif the same studies are done by somebody else we would try to except similar kind of results.Qualitative methods, the validity is more in terms of credibility of the responses thatwe get from the respondents and also the credibility of the investigator, who is doing this.Again, in terms of the generalization of the qualitative data that we get from these methods,it is more abstract and it is something that transits boundaries of cultures and we canunderstand different cultures in terms of what the participant wants to say.Whereas, in terms of quantitative methods, it is more application of the same methodologyto different cultures trying to understand different cultures using the same methods.Now, when do you use qualitative research methods?Well, we would want to do when we really want to understand, why the events happened?How did they happen?And what circumstances made them to happen?We would like to get more understanding of why these health phenomenons are occurring?We want to provide insight into the meanings of the way people behave.We would like to know, why people are behaving in a certain way.Sometimes the subject matter that we are studying is insufficiently researched and qualitativeresearch methods help us to understand these methods.Many a times, if we get into new areas, may be the subject matter vocabulary is somethingthat we need to understand as an investigator and that is again where qualitative researchwould help us to do that.In terms of social sciences, qualitative research methods actually help us to view the socialphenomenon more holistically in terms of how the participants see it through their eyes.Now, What are the various methods that we use in qualitative research?The various methods that we use are little different from the methods that we tried touse in quantitative research.In qualitative research, the methods are more interpretative and open ended, they are moreiterative rather than fixed.The methodology emerges as the research goes on rather than using a pre-structured format.In fact, qualitative research methods are done so that it becomes a partnership betweenthe participants and the investigators and the investigator actually becomes himselfor herself, an instrument in the whole research process and it is more like a co-interpreterof what the participant wants to say.The main methods that we use in qualitative research include in-depth interviews, focusgroup discussions and participant observations.We will go through one by one through each one of them.So, in-depth interviews are basically open ended interviews, which are done one to onebetween the investigator and the participant and these are done to discover the interviewee’sown framework of what they mean in their language.It is useful to obtain rich contextualized information and it also avoids imposing theinvestigator’s assumptions over what the participants wants to say.In terms of the techniques that are used in-depth interviews, although it is open ended andunstructured, we still follow what we call as an interview guide, which is a set of itemsthat we would like to discuss and get information from the participants.We use probes to get more in-depth understanding of the responses from the participants.In general, we collect the respondents’ perspective and the data as I told you beforeis more of the words and that which are recorded or noted down by the investigator.The level of structure, how we go on with the interview, varies depending on how theresponse comes from these participants and as I said this is more an emergent kind ofmethodology rather than a fixed pre-structured method.When would you like to use in-depth interviews?Well, when the subject matter is complex and we want to know more about it from the respondents,when the respondents probably are more knowledgeable about the study that we are doing.Many a times for highly sensitive subject matters like sexual behaviors or family planningissues, drug use, alcohol use, things like that, in-depth interviews are a good way tointeract more freely and get more in-depth information from research participants.Many a times, the research participants may be geographically dispersed and it is goodto talk to them one by one in different time and place and to get more information.Of course, each method has it is own advantages and disadvantages.Advantages, the in-depth interviews as per name are most in-depth.We really get to understand, why certain behaviors are practiced by individuals and why not.It gives us data on how people think.How do they conceptualize their own behavior?What is their context in terms of the way they do or think?We are able to get the exact words and language that people may use about the subject matterthat we are trying to understand and it really gives us an insider’s perspective of thesubject matter that we are trying to research on.In terms of the disadvantages, since we do few in-depth interviews and we do not do iton many people, like 100s or as we may do in quantitative methods, so there is no specificsampling.The sampling is more convenient and purposeful and we try to get people who are more knowledgeableand who will be able to give us information.This makes the findings from these interviews not generalizable in the strict quantitativesense.Many a times, the interviews usually go very long, may be 30 minutes, 40 minutes, evengo, sometimes may go to more than an hour or so and you get a lot of data which meansa lot of words and it could be time consuming to actually analyze these words.Since, the analysis is more interpretative, sometimes there is a possibility that whatthe data means the interpretation could depend on how the researcher feels and interpretsthis data rather than how the participant would may have wanted it to be known.So these are some of the pros and cons of doing in-depth interviews.The other method is Focus Group Discussions.Again these are open-ended interviews, but instead of individuals, now we have a smallgroup of people who discuss a certain topic amongst themselves.Usually, we have 6 to 8 participants, who are a homogeneous group, which means theyare supposed to be similar in terms of various characteristics, like age or gender or socioeconomic status or education, occupation, and this helps us so that the discussion goeson in a more cohesive manner.Usually, in a focus group discussion apart from, you would have a moderator, who moderatesthe whole discussion and another individual, who works as a note taker in order to takedown the notes that are being discussed.We could also have recordings, video or audio recordings of these focus group discussions,which could be used to analyze it later.Again, as in in-depth interviews we use an interview guide, which is basically a setof items that we would like the participants to discuss and we make sure that all the itemsare discussed in the way that we want them to be.However, the interview guides are flexible in the sense of, we do not have to followquestion one, question two, question three, it basically flows as the discussion flowsand the moderator is able to guide the discussion in order to obtain all the information thatis there to obtain.When do we use Focus Group Discussions?These are used in areas where group interactions give us a lot of rich information.Again, cost and timing may be issues if you were to do in-depth individual interviews,we could get information from a lot many more participants in smaller time compared to in-depthinterviews.It helps us to generate ideas because we have a group of people, who, more than one personwhose able to respond to the various ideas that we are trying to generate.It helps to identify problems and define goals.Many a times, depending on what you want, if you want to understand local terminologiesand the vocabularies, then these focus groups are a good way to understand these issues.And if you want to again look at, if there has been an intervention that has been putinto place and we would like to evaluate whether it has worked or not worked, then focus groupdiscussions are a neat way of understanding these issues.Of course, the pros and cons.We know that there are some people, who are more comfortable talking openly in group sittings,and it may be a natural way for some people to talk and so it is a nice way to understandtheir problems and personal issues.It is good way to collect information on social norms, where people can discuss these issuesamongst themselves.And as I said earlier it provides a lot of data in a limited amount of time comparedto doing individual in-depth interviews.However, the disadvantages are that since we are talking to a specific group of people,the data that is generated will depend on the actual make-up of this group and it maybe difficult to access the practice of some very personal or sensitive behaviors becausepeople may not like to talk about them in groups.Again, since these are groups of few people, the data may generally not be generalizableto the bigger target population because what we get in the information is more subjectto dominant personalities may be people who are more talkative their views may be heardmore than people who do not like to talk as much.Of course, as with in-depth interviews there would be a lot of data that is generated,many a times it runs into pages and transcribing this can be time consuming, and of courseit gives a challenge in terms of how we are able to analyze this data.The third another common method that is used in qualitative research is what is calledParticipant Observation.Now, this comes more from ethnographic and anthropological domain, wherein the researcherhimself becomes a participant in a social event or group that we are trying to study.The good thing is that we get very deep and detailed data because you as a researcher,you are part of whatever is happening in that group.However, it sometimes becomes difficult to systematically collect the data because youare right in there and it may be hard to take notes or do recordings and again the analyticalmethods that are used for participant observation data are still evolving and that can againbe a challenge in terms of the analysis.Now, coming to analysis.there are various ways in which qualitative data can be analyzed and as I told you earlier,qualitative data means text.The basically there are two ways in two methodologies that have been known to be used in terms ofthe analysis, one is called a Grounded theory approach and then there is a Content analysisapproach.The grounded theory approach goes from understanding the data and then developing theories basedon that.Whereas, content analysis is when you start of with the theoretical framework and thenyou try to analyze the data to understand the theory.What is common in both of these methods is that, first of all you need to transcribethe interviews into text, maybe from local language into English or whatever is the languageof the investigator.There is a coding of themes and categories and then relationships are built based onthese themes and categories and these are used to understand the perspective of theparticipants.And then codes are used, just as we have tables with data in quantitative research, in qualitativeresearch, if you may have seen certain papers from that, you would usually see codes fromthe interviews which are used as examples to illustrate the main theme that is generatedfrom this data.How do we use qualitative research methods?We could use qualitative research methods in different ways, it could just be used asa tool to generate ideas and basically we try as a preliminary step in developing aquantitative study.For example, if say you are trying to understand why people go, for say, open defecation, youcould, you may be developing a survey to understand this process.But in order to understand the various categories of questions, we may do a small qualitativestudy to understand what could be the probable reasons and then use it to modify the questionnairefor the quantitative survey on this subject.It could be used to help understand the results of quantitative studies.So you have done a quantitative study first and then you get results, which you need toget an in-depth understanding of why you are getting these kinds of results.And again qualitative methods could help you to do that.Or you could use qualitative research methods as the primary data collection method andthis would be where, what the objective of the study is to actually understand behaviors,get an in-depth understanding of why people do or not do certain things, why certain behaviorsare practiced or not practiced.And you get a lot of rich data in terms of using qualitative data itself.Sometimes, but not necessarily, it can be done along with the quantitative study also.Now, what is more important is that, no single method, whether it is quantitative or qualitative,would be able to give you all the explanations.They could, even you may get different explanations or different results when you use differentmethods.Plus, as an investigator, and as is important in any research study, we need to guard ourselvesagainst systematic biases in terms of data collection and in terms of actually interpretingthat data.So, it is a good thing to what we call as what we do as triangulation, which is basicallytrying to understand the same topic from different angles through different methods using differenttheories and using different data sources.There could be a triangulation of analysts or theory, which helps us to control for anyselective interpretative biases.We could use multiple methods and then focus on what information that, what is the samekind of information that we get from these methods or we could use different data sourcesfor the same study and then try to understand the differences is that emerge to these datasources and then put all of these together to actually get comprehensive understandingof the research topic that we are trying to do.How are these methods useful?In general, qualitative research methods are very good to actually identify the determinantsof health, why do people behave in a certain way?What are their attitudes?What do they perceive in terms of what they are doing or not doing?If there have been certain interventions already done qualitative research methods are a goodway to understand, why these interventions have been successful or not successful.Qualitative research methods are again a good tool to explain may be various problems thatmay have arisen in terms of, why people make certain choices?Or why people use certain services or not use certain services?And in general overall again they are a good way to understand the context in which certaindecisions are made whether at the policy level or a social or a legal level.So, just to sum up, we have the 2 paradigms of research, qualitative research and quantitativeresearch.Qualitative research is a very good way to explore, to understand why and to seek a moredepth in understanding of the topic that we are trying to study.While we are doing that it is always good to use the advantages of both qualitativeand quantitative methods to enrich our research process.And of course, triangulate the various methods to check whether the analysis that we aregetting is something that can be enriching and fruitful.
