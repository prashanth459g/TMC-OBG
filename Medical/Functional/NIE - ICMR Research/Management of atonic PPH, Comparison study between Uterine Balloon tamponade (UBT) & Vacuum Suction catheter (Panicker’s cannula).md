# Research Protocol 
## Title - "**Management of atonic PPH, Comparison study for amount of blood loss between Uterine Balloon tamponade (UBT) & Vacuum Suction catheter (Panicker’s cannula)**"

Alternative - Prospective observational study regarding amount of blood loss when atonic PPH managed with suction cannula

## Introduction
Postpartum haemorrhage (PPH) remains the leading cause of maternal mortality.[^1],[^2] Most diagnosed PPH is due to atony and is controlled by administration of uterotonics; however, some women continue to bleed and require interventions such as blood transfusion or surgery. Globally, Postpartum hemorrhage accounts for about 25% of maternal death[^3]. WHO estimated about 20 million maternal morbidities annually due to obstetric hemorrhage. In developing countries, postpartum hemorrhage plays a greater role in maternal morbidity[^4]. However, maternal mortality rate falls by 44% globally over the past 25 years as estimated by WHO. PPH may occur in 1-5% of deliveries in both developed and developing countries[^5]. 
In India, postpartum hemorrhage continues to be the leading cause of maternal mortality. Place of the delivery and severity of the hemorrhage determines the maternal outcome. If a woman delivered develops PPH in a well-equipped health facility, immediate medical and the surgical interventions are possible. It is not so, when the woman deliver at a small hospital or home, as they are ill-equipped with facilities to manage PPH. Diagnosis of PPH and making decision to transfer the patient to tertiary care is very crucial. PPH can kill the healthy women in 2 hours if unattended[^6]. Hence, the first 1 or 2 hours are rightly said as “Golden hours”[^7]. Due to hemorrhagic shock, some women slip into coagulation failure and the multi-organ dysfunction syndrome. Maternal mortality in low resource setting is not coming down due to these complex reasons[^8]. 
According to Millineum developmental goal, maternal mortality reduction can be achieved if only PPH management is prioritized[^9]. Many studies emphasized that maternal morbidity and mortality due to PPH can be prevented with prompt recognition and timely management[^10][^11][^12][^13][^14][^15]

Title: Management of Atonic Postpartum Hemorrhage: A Comparative Study of Uterine Balloon Tamponade and Vacuum Suction Catheter

Introduction:

-   Atonic postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) is a significant cause of maternal morbidity and mortality worldwide.
-   There are several methods for managing PPH, including uterine balloon tamponade (UBT) and vacuum suction catheter (Panicker's cannula).
-   The purpose of this study is to compare the amount of blood loss between UBT and Panicker's cannula in the management of atonic PPH.

Objectives:

-   To compare the amount of blood loss between UBT and Panicker's cannula in women with atonic PPH.
-   To assess the effectiveness and safety of UBT and Panicker's cannula in the management of atonic PPH.

Methods:

-   This will be a prospective, randomized, controlled study involving women with atonic PPH.
-   Participants will be randomly assigned to receive either UBT or Panicker's cannula.
-   The amount of blood loss will be measured using a standardized method, such as measuring the volume of blood in a graduated container or by weighing the blood-soaked pads.
-   The effectiveness and safety of the interventions will be assessed using established clinical criteria, such as hematocrit levels, vital signs, and adverse events.
-   The data collected will be analyzed using appropriate statistical methods to compare the amount of blood loss between the two groups.

Sample Size:

-   The sample size will be calculated based on the anticipated difference in blood loss between the two groups and the desired level of precision.
-   A power analysis will be performed to determine the minimum sample size required to detect a clinically significant difference between the two groups.

Data Analysis:

-   The data will be analyzed using descriptive statistics to summarize the baseline characteristics of the participants.
-   Inferential statistics, such as independent sample t-tests or Mann-Whitney U tests, will be used to compare the amount of blood loss between the two groups.
-   The effectiveness and safety of the interventions will be assessed using appropriate statistical methods, such as chi-squared tests or Fisher's exact tests.

Ethical Considerations:

-   The study will be approved by the institutional review board (IRB) and will comply with all applicable ethical guidelines, such as the Declaration of Helsinki.
-   Written informed consent will be obtained from all participants before enrolling them in the study.
-   The study will be conducted in accordance with good clinical practice (GCP) guidelines.

Expected Outcomes:

-   The results of this study will provide valuable information on the comparative effectiveness and safety of UBT and Panicker's cannula in the management of atonic PPH.
-   This information will be useful for clinicians and policymakers in selecting the most appropriate intervention for managing atonic PPH.
-   The findings of this study may also inform the development of future guidelines and protocols for the management of PPH.

Conclusion:

-   The proposed study will provide important information on the management of atonic PPH, which is a significant cause of maternal morbidity and mortality worldwide.
-   The results of this study will be valuable for clinicians, policymakers, and researchers in their efforts to improve the management of PPH and reduce maternal mortality.

Title: "Comparison of Blood Loss between Uterine Balloon Tamponade and Vacuum Suction Catheter in the Management of Atonic Postpartum Hemorrhage"

Introduction:

-   Brief overview of the problem: Atonic postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) is a leading cause of maternal mortality and morbidity worldwide.
-   Background of the study: There are various methods available for the management of PPH, including UBT and vacuum suction catheter (VSC).
-   Purpose of the study: This study aims to compare the amount of blood loss between UBT and VSC in the management of atonic PPH and determine the most effective method.

Methods:

-   Study Design: A randomized controlled trial will be conducted to compare the amount of blood loss between UBT and VSC in women with atonic PPH.
-   Participants: The study will enroll women with atonic PPH who are admitted to the maternity unit within 24 hours of delivery.
-   Intervention: Participants will be randomly assigned to either the UBT group or the VSC group.
-   Outcome measures: The primary outcome measure will be the amount of blood loss, measured in milliliters, at 30 minutes, 1 hour, and 2 hours after the intervention.
-   Statistical analysis: Descriptive statistics and inferential statistics will be used to analyze the data. A two-sample t-test will be used to compare the mean blood loss between the two groups.

Ethical considerations:

-   Approval from the institutional review board will be obtained before the study is initiated.
-   Informed consent will be obtained from all participants.
-   Confidentiality of participant data will be maintained.

Expected results:

-   The results of this study are expected to provide evidence on the most effective method for the management of atonic PPH, which will inform clinical practice and help reduce maternal mortality and morbidity.

Conclusion:

-   The findings of this study will add to the existing body of evidence on the management of PPH and contribute to the development of effective interventions for the management of atonic PPH.
