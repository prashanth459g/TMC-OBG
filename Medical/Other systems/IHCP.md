# IHCP
- Now coming to the lesser benign type Intrahepatic Cholestasis of pregnancy, is a multifactorial condition of pregnancy characterized by pruritus' in the absence of skin rash with abnormal LFT
	- usually diagnosis of exclusion
	- if you have a rash, you cannot diagnose IHCP. You have to go for looking for any dermatological conditions causing pruritus'. Otherwise, no rash then you can keep the option of IHCP open with abnormal liver function test. 
- incidence rate is 0.5 to 1%. 
- family history past history both of them suggest there could be a genetic inheritance *autosomal dominant sex linked* family history has been found to be associated with ==HLA B8 & HLA Bw16== 
- Cholestasis
	- So what exactly do you mean by cholestasis in Simple terms. obstruction of bile excretion that can occur anywhere between the basolateral membrane (sinusoids of liver) up to the ampulla of Vater. anywhere if you have obstruction, it causes cholestasis. But here it happens in the sinusoids of the liver. So that is called acute cholestasis of pregnancy
	- **functionally** :- it is a decrease in canalicular bile flow. There is decreased hepatic secretion of water and/or organic anions(bilirubin, bile acid)
	- **morphologically** :- tit is accumulation of bile in the liver cells and biliary passages. 
	- **clinically** :- it is by the increase in the retention of substances in blood which normally should have gone out 
### Clinical Features 
- itching + ↑ ALP + ↑ GGT
- Itching 
	- almost always present, But in some cases there may not be itching. 
	- More common in the palms and souls
	- more severe in the night -> insomnia -> malaise may be the complaint 
	- no rashes. Again, I am stressing there could be excoriations of the skin.
- Jaundice is usually mild, dark urine, pale stools, steatorrhea & anorexia could be there depending on the level of obstruction and stasis 
	- Weight loss could be great. As I told you, Steatorrhea correlates very well with the severity of the condition. 
- And there is increased serum alkaline phosphatase and gamma glutamyl transpeptidase could be increased. 
- Usually present in 3rd semester 
- HCV infection most often increases the risk of the intra hepatic cholesterol, and it also causes an early onset of IHCP. 
	- So IHCP can come before 29 weeks of gestation or probably even late in the second trimester it can make its appearance, 
	- but almost complete recovery is known after delivery 
	- in these cases of IHCP, liver function tests are abnormal. 
- Exogenous estrogen or high estrogen may be the etiological factor for cholestasis
	- as you know in pregnancy with high estrogen may be a trigger
- Environmental causes also could play a role. You find lot of regional difference. You know Scandinavian & other European countries there is a very high incidence and compared toAsia. So there could be some environmental factor suggested by this region variation. 
- Histopathology again reveals focal and irregular Cholestasis, but we don't really do any kind of biopsy here. 

### Lab Diagnosis 
- Moderate(<u>but less than</u> threefold) elevation of AST and ALT(most sensitive). 
- Alkaline phosphatase is raised whenever there is an obstruction to the flow. 
- You have a raised GGT in almost in about 20% of the cases. 
- Bilirubin is mildly elevated(less common). You really don't see severe jaundice in these women. 
- Increased serum total bile acids(primary bile acids - *cholic & chenodeoxycholic acid*) concentration. This is the ==hallmark of this disease==. 
	- may increase 10-100 fold
	- Normal value ![[Gastrointestinal System#^423fa0]]
- It is always a diagnosis of exclusion. So viral markers are advised 
- USG is done to rule out causes for other obstruction 
- antibody tests will help us to rule out ?CAH
- **Types**
	- Depending on the bile acids level (*micromol/L*)
	- Gestational pruritis -> Mild [[IHCP|ICP]] -> Moderate [[IHCP|ICP]] -> Severe [[IHCP|ICP]] 
	- <19-----19 to 39 ---- 40 to 99 ---- ≥100

### Feto-maternal effect
- Bile acids of >1.634 milligram per deciliter is usually the critical value beyond which you have the most adverse outcomes. 
- So vitamin K deficiency is known, and these women can have PPH because mainly of vitamin K deficiency
- in intrahepatic cholesterol pregnancy, the maternal outcome is good. But the perinatal outcome is guarded, so it could be because of
	- Intrapartum fetal distress, intrauterine fetal demise, meconium stained amniotic fluid and preterm delivery, preterm delivery (many a times could be iatrogenic). 
	- Perinatal mortality to the tune of one to 2%. 
	- So these are the complications that one is really bothered in cases of IHCP, here the problem is that everything looks benign, but suddenly the mother loses the baby highly unexplainable. What I meant by everything looks normally is even fatal monitoring looks normal. Today morning you have done a CTG. Everything is fine evening. She can come with the dead baby. So very difficult to explain the situation.
	- *Fetal monitoring is useless here*
- Successfully management these conditions because it depends on the bile acid levels. 
	- If it is <40 micromol/L then the risk is supposed to be very, very less not significant at all. 
	- Cholic acid is known to cause a ==dose dependent vasoconstriction on human placental chorionic veins== that could be the causeway for causing IUD. 
	- But unfortunately no method of fetal surveillance will say that this baby will have a good outcome or this baby will have an adverse outcome.
		- As any level if bile acid may not show any effect on CTG/doppler
		- i.e. no predictor for adverse fetal outcome, except MSAF which requires amniocenesis

### Management 
- Bile acid levels with LFT weekly in women who show a normal LFT, but only Pruritis. 
- Check for Prothrombin time around the time of delivery, because there is a small risk of the coagulation factors coming down because of the liver dysfunction. And if you find that PT is prolonged, it is ideal to give a dose of `water soluble` vitamin K. 
	- Remember normally vitamin K is a fat soluble and available as a fat soluble preparation. But because the fact metabolism is affected here you give Water soluble inj.vitamin K 5-10 mg/day. 
- Fetal monitoring may not be very useful, so no suggested recommendation to follow a certain regime in the fatal monitoring. 
- For pruritis, you can use antihistamines like chloropheniramine or promethazine. 
	- Topical emoluments are useful, especially for the excoriation and the itching
- Steroids have no role in causing an improvement in these symptoms. 
- Delivery
	- usually deliveries planned at 36 to 37 weeks if the bile acids are very high, it is really scary. It is really risky. It is really not very well understood mechanism. Why do they be dies?
	- Careful & continuous intrapartum monitoring 
	- Increased risk of postpartum hemorrhage.
	- increased risk of cesarean delivery because of the concern of some intrapartum adverse events. 
- Postpartum
	- usually LFT is not repeated immediately after delivery. Ideally is repeated 10 days after the delivery
	- recurrence rate is 90% in subsequent pregnancy
- Whenever you are advising contraception, avoid estrogen containing contraception. 
	- Others like IUCD or barrier methods or even progesterone only methods could be suggested, but estrogen containing methods could be causing or worsening the condition.
	- if HRT is necessary is not contraindicated in these women

### Medication 
- Ursodeoxycholic acid
	- Choleretic agent that reduces serum bile acids
	- 1000 to 2500 mg/day divided into TID 
	- it is not an approved drug in pregnancy, but many use this in the 2nd and 3rd trimester of pregnancy.
	- No effect on perinatal outcome or Timing of delivery is not influenced by this drug, 
	- but it can cause some reduction in the itching 
- Tried
	- Rifampicin has been tried by some to improve the symptoms and biochemical markers of liver injury, but has not been well studied. It has been used tried in the dosage of 150 to 300 milligrams. 
	- S-adenosyl methionine 
	- Guar gum
- Steroids are not recommended for use in IHCP for itching.
