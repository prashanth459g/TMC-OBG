# Metabolic syndrome
- Metabolic syndrome (syndrome X, insulin resistance) is a multifactorial disease with multiple risk factors that arises from insulin resistance accompanying abnormal adipose deposition and function. 
- It comprises a combination of risk factors for coronary heart disease, as well as for diabetes, fatty liver, and several cancers.
## Overview
### Signs and symptoms
- Clinical manifestations of metabolic syndrome include the following:
	-   Hypertension
	-   Hyperglycemia
	-   Hypertriglyceridemia
	-   Reduced high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C)
	-   Abdominal obesity
	-   Chest pain or shortness of breath: Suggesting the rise of cardiovascular and other complications
	-   Acanthosis nigricans, hirsutism, peripheral neuropathy, and retinopathy: In patients with insulin resistance and hyperglycemia or with diabetes mellitus
	-   Xanthomas or xanthelasmas: In patients with severe dyslipidemia
### Diagnosis
- According to guidelines from the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) and the American Heart Association (AHA), metabolic syndrome is diagnosed when a patient has at least 3 of the following 5 conditions:
	-   Fasting glucose â‰¥100 mg/dL (or receiving drug therapy for hyperglycemia)
	-   Blood pressure â‰¥130/85 mm Hg (or receiving drug therapy for hypertension)
	-   Triglycerides â‰¥150 mg/dL (or receiving drug therapy for hypertriglyceridemia)
	-   HDL-C < 40 mg/dL in men or < 50 mg/dL in women (or receiving drug therapy for reduced HDL-C)
	-   Waist circumference â‰¥102 cm (40 in) in men or â‰¥88 cm (35 in) in women; if Asian American, â‰¥90 cm (35 in) in men or â‰¥80 cm (32 in) in women. (The international diabetes federation (IDF) criteria allow the use of a body mass index BMI >30 kg/m2 in lieu of the waist circumference criterion.)   

- Complaints of chest pain, dyspnea, or claudication (symptoms of possible complications) may warrant additional studies, including the following:
	-   Electrocardiography (rest/stress ECG)
	-   Ultrasonography (vascular, or rest/stress echocardiography)
	-   Stress single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) or cardiac positron emission tomography (PET)
- Investigation into other causes of or exacerbating factors in metabolic syndrome should be considered. For example, sleep-related breathing disorders, such as obstructive sleep apnea, are becoming increasingly relevant and novel risk factors for metabolic syndrome.
### Management
- Lifestyle change and weight loss are considered the most important initial steps in treating metabolic syndrome. Studies comparing ethnically similar populations exposed to different dietary environments have suggested that westernized diets are strongly associated with a higher risk of developing metabolic syndrome.[5]
- The following medications can be used to treat dyslipidemia and other manifestations of metabolic syndrome:
	-   Elevated LDL-C levels: Statins    
	-   Decreased HDL-C levels: Consider niacin
	-   Elevated triglyceride levels: Consider niacin, fibrates, and omega-3 fatty acids
	-   Hyperglycemia: Insulin-sensitizing agent, such as metformin
- Treatment of associated obstructive sleep apnea may also play a significant role in the management of metabolic syndrome.

## Background
## Pathophysiology
- Target organ damage occurs through multiple mechanisms in metabolic syndrome. The individual diseases leading to metabolic syndrome produce adverse clinical consequences. 
	- For example, hypertension in metabolic syndrome causes left ventricular hypertrophy, progressive peripheral arterial disease, and renal dysfunction.
	- However, the cumulative risk for metabolic syndrome appears to cause microvascular dysfunction, which further amplifies insulin resistance and promotes hypertension.
	- Metabolic syndrome promotes coronary heart disease through several mechanisms. 
	- It increases the thrombogenicity of circulating blood, in part by raising plasminogen activator type 1 and adipokine levels, and it causes endothelial dysfunction.
	- Metabolic syndrome may also increase cardiovascular risks by increasing arterial stiffness.
	- Additional mechanisms include oxidative stress, which has been associated with numerous components of metabolic syndrome.
## Etiology
- The underlying etiology for metabolic syndrome remains unclear. However, known risk factors for metabolic syndrome include family history, poor diet, and inadequate exercise. 
	- Two forces that have spread metabolic syndrome globally are the increased availability and consumption ofÂ high calorie-low fiber fast food as well as decreased physical activity engendered by sedentary lifestyles and mechanized transportation.
- Contributing factors and mechanisms appear to include the following :
	-   Insulin resistance
    -   Pancreatic beta-cell dysfunction
    -   Cellular dysfunction by protein kinases and phoshatases
    -   Suppression of insulin receptor substrate-1 and 2 (IRS1/IRS2) gene expression and function
    -   Obesity and lipid toxicity
    -   Oxidative stress and glucose toxicity
    -   Chronic inflammation
    -   Dysrupted circadian rhythm
    -   Genetics and epigenetics
    -   Gut microbial imbalance
    -   Dietary effects

Metabolic syndrome is thought to be caused by adipose tissue dysfunction and insulin resistance. Dysfunctional adipose tissue also plays an important role in the pathogenesis of obesity-related insulin resistance.[22] Â Both adipose cell enlargement and infiltration of macrophages into adipose tissue result in the release of proinflammatory cytokines and promote insulin resistance.[23]

Insulin resistance appears to be the primary mediator of metabolic syndrome.[24] Insulin promotes glucose uptake in muscle, fat, and liver cells and can influence lipolysis and the production of glucose by hepatocytes.

Additional contributors to insulin resistance include abnormalities in insulin secretion and insulin receptor signaling, impaired glucose disposal, and proinflammatory cytokines. These abnormalities, in turn, may result from obesity with related increases in free fatty acid levels and changes in insulin distribution (insulin accumulates in fat).

The distribution of adipose tissue appears to affect its role in metabolic syndrome. Fat that is visceral or intra-abdominal correlates with inflammation, whereas subcutaneous fat does not. There are a number of potential explanations for this, including experimental observations that omental fat is more resistant to insulin and may result in a higher concentration of toxic free fatty acids in the portal circulation.[25]

Abdominal fat is known to produce potentially harmful levels of cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor, adiponectin, leptin, resistin, and plasminogen activator inhibitor.[26]

Psychological characteristics, including anger, depression, and hostility, may be linked to increased risk for metabolic syndrome.[27] However, psychological disorders, especially anxiety, may represent comorbidity or a complication of metabolic syndrome.[28] Clearly, further study is warranted.

## Prognosis
- The complications of metabolic syndrome are broad. Numerous associated cardiovascular complications exist, particularly coronary heart disease, but also atrial fibrillation,[57, 58] heart failure,[59] aortic stenosis,[60] ischemic stroke,[61] and, possibly, venothromboembolic disease.[62] Â Cardiovascular disease and diabetes mellitus coexist and are two leading causes of death.[10, 20] Â Evidence also exists to indicate that upregulation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and derangements to metabolic pathways (eg, glucose and fat metabolism) can also promote pulmonary vascular disease (eg, pulmonary arterial hypertension) and right heart failure.[59]

Emerging data suggest an important correlation between metabolic syndrome and risk of stroke.[63] Each of the components of metabolic syndrome has been associated with elevated stroke risk, and evidence demonstrates a relationship between the collective metabolic syndrome and risk of ischemic stroke.[64] Metabolic syndrome may also be linked to neuropathy beyond hyperglycemic mechanisms through inflammatory mediators.[65]

The metabolic derangements that characterize metabolic syndrome have been implicated in the development of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.[66, 67] Indeed, the fatty liver is thought to play an important role in the development of metabolic syndrome.[68]

In addition, metabolic syndrome has been implicated in the pathophysiology of several other diseases, including obstructive sleep apnea. Breast cancer has also been linked to metabolic syndrome, possibly through dysregulation of the plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) cycle.[69] Additional studies have linked metabolic syndrome with cancers of the colon, gallbladder, kidney, and, possibly, prostate gland.[70] Evidence is emerging of an association with psoriasis.[71, 72]

Metabolic syndrome between pregnancies increases the risk of recurrent preeclampsia, according to a retrospective cohort study of 197 women who had preeclampsia during their first pregnancy. Of the 197 women, 40 (20%) had metabolic syndrome between pregnancies. Of these 40 women, 18 (45%) had preeclampsia during their second pregnancy, compared with 27 (17%) of the 157 women without metabolic syndrome between pregnancies. The risk of recurrent preeclampsia increased with the number of components of the metabolic syndrome present.[73, 74]

Additional research has raised the possibility that metabolic syndrome adversely affects neurocognitive performance.[75] In particular, metabolic syndrome has been blamed for accelerated cognitive aging.[76] Patients with mental illnesses also face increased cardiometabolic risk due at least in part to socioeconomic factors such as greater poverty and poorer access to medical care.[77, 78]

Paradoxically, metabolic syndrome was associated with a lower risk of bone fractures in a meta-analysis.[79] Further study is warranted.

## Presentation

## History

As with other diseases, careful history taking is important in metabolic syndrome. Even though the condition is diagnosed based on physical and laboratory features, it may be suspected if symptoms of any of the component disorders are present, such as the increased hunger, thirst, or urination that may accompany hyperglycemia.

Patients reporting a history of hypertension, dyslipidemia, or hyperglycemia warrant screening for metabolic syndrome. Symptoms suggesting the rise of cardiovascular and other complications, such as chest pain or shortness of breath, must be investigated carefully. As lifestyle changes can ameliorate the condition, attention should be paid to the patientâ€™s dietary habits and exercise routines so that areas for improvement can be identified.

The patientâ€™s social history is important for identifying additional risks, such as tobacco use, which may exacerbate the increased cardiovascular complications associated with metabolic syndrome.

A family history should be obtained because genetics may play an important role in metabolic syndrome. This feature of the disease is under active investigation; however, no gene or group of genes has yet been implicated consistently, suggesting that environment exerts substantial influence.[80]

Finally, a thorough review of systems may help to identify related problems, such as menstrual irregularities that can be seen in polycystic ovarian syndrome.

## Physical Examination

The physical examination is crucial in patients with metabolic syndrome, as the findings of elevated blood pressure and abdominal obesity are 2 of the 5 diagnostic criteria. Measurement and documentation of waist circumference are important routines when screening for metabolic syndrome.

The examination may also reveal findings reflective of the other criteria. For example, patients with insulin resistance and hyperglycemia or with diabetes mellitus may have acanthosis nigricans, hirsutism, peripheral neuropathy, and retinopathy. Patients with severe dyslipidemia may have xanthomas or xanthelasmas. The presence of arterial bruits may portend a higher risk of cardiovascular complications.

## Diagnostic Considerations

Additional diagnoses should be considered for each of the criteria used to identify patients with metabolic syndrome. For example, in patients with hypertension, investigation for secondary causes, such as obstructive sleep apnea or other sleep-related breathing disorders, renovascular disease, or disorders of renin and aldosterone metabolism may be warranted under appropriate circumstances.

Patients with dyslipidemia in the setting of a strong family history of dyslipidemia may be manifesting hereditary disease. Alternative causes of hyperglycemia may include not only diabetes mellitus but also thyroid dysfunction and rarer endocrinopathies, such as glucagonomas and pheochromocytomas.

## Workup

## Approach Considerations

Initial laboratory studies in patients suspected of having metabolic syndrome should include standard chemistries to assess for hyperglycemia and renal dysfunction and lipid studies to assess for hypertriglyceridemia or low HDL levels.

If a family history of early coronary or other atherosclerotic disease is present, consider including, in addition to HDL-C and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), studies of lipoprotein(a), apolipoprotein-B100, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (CRP), and (if the patient does not already merit the lowest LDL-C target [< 70]), homocysteine and fractionated LDL-C.

In view of the various associations between metabolic syndrome and other conditions discussed elsewhere in this article, additional helpful blood tests may include thyroid and liver studies, hemoglobin-A1C levels, and uric acid. Increased thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) has been linked to a higher prevalence of metabolic syndrome.[81] Hyperuricemia appears to be much more common in patients with metabolic syndrome than in the general population, and this is attributed to the inflammatory effects of metabolic syndrome.[82] Further studies should be pursued as clinical findings dictate.

### Imaging studies

Imaging studies are not routinely indicated in the diagnosis of metabolic syndrome. However, they may be appropriate for patients with symptoms or signs of the many complications of the syndrome, including cardiovascular disease. Complaints of chest pain, dyspnea, or claudication may warrant additional testing with electrocardiography (rest/stress ECG), ultrasonography (vascular or rest/stress echocardiography), stress single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), cardiac positron emission tomography (PET), or other imaging studies.

### Testing for sleep-related breathing disorder

Investigation into other causes or exacerbating factors should be considered. For example, sleep-related breathing disorders, such as obstructive sleep apnea, are becoming increasingly relevant and novel risk factors for metabolic syndrome.[4]

The difficulty in clarifying the associations between obstructive sleep apnea and metabolic syndrome lie in part with the confounding effect of obesity.[83] Nevertheless, patients reporting significant sleep disturbances, snoring, possible pauses, and/or daytime drowsiness may benefit from further investigation for a treatable sleep-related breathing disorder, including through polysomnography.

### Cardiovascular risk assessment

New guidelines on the assessment of cardiovascular risk, released in late 2013 by the American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology (AHA/ACC), recommend use of a revised calculator for the risk of developing a first atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) event, which is defined as one of the following in a person who was initially free from ASCVD[84] :

-   Nonfatal myocardial infarction
    
-   Death from coronary heart disease
    
-   Stroke (fatal or nonfatal)
    

The calculator uses 9 clinical and laboratory risk factors to determine 10-year and lifetime risk.

For patients 20-79 years of age who do not have existing clinical ASCVD, the guidelines recommend assessing clinical risk factors every 4-6 years. For patients with low 10-year risk (< 7.5%), the guidelines recommend assessing 30-year or lifetime risk in patients 20-59 years old. Regardless of the patientâ€™s age, clinicians should communicate risk data to the patient and refer to the AHA/ACC lifestyle guidelines, which cover diet and physical activity. For patients with elevated 10-year risk, clinicians should communicate risk data and refer to the AHA/ACC guidelines on blood cholesterol and obesity.[84]

## Treatment

## Approach Considerations

The initial management of metabolic syndrome involves lifestyle modifications, including changes in diet and exercise habits.[85] Indeed, evidence exists to support the notion that the diet, exercise, and pharmacologic interventions may inhibit the progression of metabolic syndrome to diabetes mellitus.[86]

Treatment of hypertension had been based on the recommendations of the Seventh Report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC-7) guidelines, to achieve a goal blood pressure of less than 140/90 mm Hg or, in patients meeting diagnostic criteria for diabetes mellitus, less than 130/80 mm Hg. However, the 2014 report of the Eight Joint National Committee (JNC-8) has led to less stringent recommendations for drug therapy (140/90 mm Hg for most populations, 150/90 mm Hg for patients aged 60 or older),[87] with continued emphasis on the importance of promoting healthy diet and exercise behaviors, as addressed by 2013 guidelines from the American College of Cardiology.[88, 89] Â Nevertheless, more recent study data continue to support a more aggressive blood pressure goal of 120/80 mm Hg.

### Surgical considerations

At present, no surgical interventions for metabolic syndrome have been widely accepted. However, trials of bariatric surgery in patients who were morbidly obese and had metabolic syndrome suggested beneficial results, including decreased insulin resistance and lower levels of inflammatory cytokines.[90]

Importantly, metabolic syndrome raises specific perioperative issues that should be considered in patients with metabolic syndrome undergoing any major surgical procedure.[91]

### Treatment of obstructive sleep apnea

Treatment of associated obstructive sleep apnea may play a significant role in the management of metabolic syndrome.[92] In a 2011 study, patients with at least moderate obstructive sleep apnea who used continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy for 3 months showed significant improvements in their metabolic profile, including reductions in systolic and diastolic blood pressure, LDL-C, triglycerides, and glycated hemoglobin. Furthermore, reversal of metabolic syndrome occurred to a greater degree in the CPAP therapy group than in patients who underwent sham treatment (13% vs 1%, respectively).[93]

### Consultations

Patients with diabetes should be referred to a diabetic nutritionist, if not an endocrinologist. Patients with cardiac symptoms (chest pain, shortness of breath, palpitations) or an abnormal stress test may merit referral to a cardiologist. Consider referral to a preventive cardiologist for primary or secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease in these high-risk patients. Consultation with a sleep specialist is indicated if there are symptoms suggestive of sleep apnea, such as excessive fatigue or daytime somnolence, a history of snoring and witnessed apneas, or physical signs of untreated apnea such as resistant hypertension.

Patients who are at high risk for obesity-associated morbidity and mortality with a BMI greater than 40 kg/m2 or with a BMI greater than 35 kg/m2 plus 1 or more significant comorbid conditions may be referred for consideration of bariatric surgery when less invasive methods of weight loss have failed.

Some advocate using the 130/80 mm Hg goal in all patients with metabolic syndrome, as well as using angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) rather than diuretics or beta blockers when medication is indicated.[94]
## Pharmacologic Therapy

### Correction of LDL-C and HDL-C levels

Management of elevated LDL-C includes consideration of all statins (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A [HMG-CoA] reductase inhibitors) at all indicated ranges, as there are several formulations available with different doses and potencies. Statins affect the lipid profile favorably and provide possible pleiotropic benefits.[95] The choice of drug and dose should be individualized to the patient and titrated to achieve guideline-recommended goals. As a class, statins are pregnancy category "X" (contraindicated; benefit does not outweigh risk).

Management of reduced HDL-C remains controversial, but starts with diet/exercise modifications and may include niacin. Certain statins (such as rosuvastatin) may help, but this is not yet a widely accepted indication.

Cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) inhibitors have been studied as potential agents to raise HDL-C levels in a clinically meaningful manner. Though torcetrapib increased HDL-C levels, it failed to improve clinical outcomes in the ILLUSTRATE (Investigation of Lipid level Management Using Coronary Ultrasound To Assess Reduction of Atherosclerosis by CETP Inhibition and HDL Elevation) trial.[96] Another CETP inhibitor, anacetrapib, remains in development, and the ongoing DEFINE (Determining the Efficacy and Tolerability of CETP Inhibition with Anacetrapib) trial is expected to shed light on this agentâ€™s potential for reducing clinical cardiovascular events.[97]

Fibrate therapy may serve as an important adjunct in overweight patients with elevated triglyceride and low HDL-C levels (a combination known as atherogenic dyslipidemia).[98]

Niacin raises low HDL-C levels and reduces cardiovascular events but may exacerbate hyperglycemia, especially in high doses (>1500 mg/day), so careful monitoring is recommended.[99]

The latest cholesterol guidelines from the American College of Cardiology emphasize the use of statins over nonstatin therapies, and recommend re-emphasis on adherence to statin and lifestyle therapies before resorting to nonstatin therapies.[100]

### Triglyceride treatment

When lifestyle modifications fail, medical therapy for elevated triglycerides may include niacin and fibrates, though a distinction should be made between gemfibrozil and fenofibrate/fenofibric acid due to their different dosing patterns and different propensities for drug interactions, particularly if combined with a statin. The addition of omega-3 fatty acids to treatment is also likely to help lower triglyceride levels.[101]

### Hyperglycemia treatment

Drug therapy for hyperglycemia in patients with metabolic syndrome typically begins with an insulin-sensitizing agent, such as metformin. Some literature suggests that metformin may help to reverse the pathophysiologic changes of metabolic syndrome. This includes when it is used in combination with lifestyle changes[102] or with peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor agonists, such as the fibrates[103] and thiazolidinediones (eg, pioglitazone, rosiglitazone),[104, 105] each of which may produce favorable metabolic alterations as single agents in patients with metabolic syndrome.[106]

Management of diabetes mellitus, including screening for end-organ complications, should proceed under current guidelines.[107]

### Preventive cardiovascular treatment

Aspirin therapy may be helpful in the primary prevention of cardiovascular complications,[108] particularly in patients with at least an intermediate risk of suffering a cardiovascular event (ie, >6% 10 y risk).[109]

### Complementary and alternative medicine

The use of complementary and alternative medications for metabolic syndrome has limited literature support. Traditional Chinese medicines may have a role, as a variety of agents, including ginseng, berberine, and bitter gourd, have demonstrated some favorable metabolic effects, but large-scale clinical trials are needed to fully investigate their safety and efficacy.[110]

A variety of other complementary and alternative treatments may have a potential role in the management of metabolic syndrome[111] and additional study remains warranted.

![eMedicine Logo](https://img.medscapestatic.com/pi/global/logos/emed/logo-emedicine77x17.svg)

## Diet

Lifestyle change and weight loss are considered the most important initial steps in treating metabolic syndrome. Studies comparing ethnically similar populations exposed to different dietary environments suggested that Westernized diets are strongly associated with a higher risk of developing metabolic syndrome.[5]

On the other hand, diets rich in dairy, fish, and cereal grains may be associated with a lower risk of developing metabolic syndrome.[112, 113] Not surprisingly, Mediterranean-style diets appear to be associated with a much lower risk and possibly with resolution of metabolic syndrome in patients who have met diagnostic criteria, especially when coupled with adequate exercise regimens.[114]

A meta-analysis of multiple population studies associated chocolate consumption with a substantial risk reduction (approximately 30%) for cardiometabolic disorders, including coronary disease, cardiac deaths, diabetes, and stroke.[115] The apparent benefits of chocolate may accrue from a beneficial impact of polyphenols present in cocoa products that increase the bioavailability of nitric oxide.

Epidemiologic studies, particularly in males, suggest that moderate wine intake may protect against the development and complications of metabolic syndrome, an effect that is at least partially attributable to polyphenols, such as resveratrol, found in red wines.[116, 117]

The impact of sugar consumption on the risk of developing metabolic syndrome is controversial. Evidence suggests that absolute fructose intake may relate to incident metabolic syndrome.[118] Higher fructose diets have been blamed for elevated rates of metabolic syndrome in African American populations.[119]

However, glycemic load or intake does not appear to predispose persons to the development of metabolic syndrome, though avoidance of high-glycemic-index foods in patients with metabolic syndrome may improve characteristic parameters such as atherogenic dyslipidemia.[120]

In a single-blind, parallel, controlled, dietary intervention study, subjects with metabolic syndrome (n=472) from 8 European countries classified by different insulin resistance (IR) levels according to a homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) were randomly assigned to 4 diets: a high-saturated fatty acid (HSFA) diet; a high-monounsaturated fatty acid (HMUFA) diet; a low-fat, high-complex carbohydrate (LFHCC) diet supplemented with long-chain n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (1.2 g/d); or an LFHCC diet supplemented with placebo for 12 weeks (control). The results provided evidence that subjectsâ€™ degree of insulin resistance determines response to the quantity and quality of dietary fat on metabolic syndrome risk factors.[121]

## Activity

Exercise is thought to be an important intervention,[122] and the current recommendation is for patients to perform regular moderate-intensity physical activity for at least 30 minutes continuously at least 5 days per week (ideally, 7 days per week). Maintaining long-term adherence, however, remains a challenge.[123] Â Achieving moderate intensity activity for 120 to 150 minutes a week may reduce the risk of developing metabolic syndrome.[124] Â Among patients who already have metabolic syndrome, physical activity correlates with a much lower (about 50%) risk of developing coronary heart disease.[125]

In a prospective study, cardiorespiratory fitness was linked to the risk of developing metabolic syndrome in a dose-dependent manner, with male patients in the highest category of fitness having the lowest risk of developing new-onset metabolic syndrome.[126]

Evidence suggests that excessive sitting and other behaviors that are low in activity and energy expenditure may trigger unique cellular responses that contribute to the development of metabolic syndrome.[127]

## Deterrence and Prevention

In 2010, the American Heart Association-American Stroke Association (AHA-ASA) updated their guidelines for the primary prevention of stroke. These are described below.[128]

### Hypertension

Regular blood pressure screening, lifestyle modification, and drug therapy are recommended. A lower risk of stroke and cardiovascular events are seen when systolic blood pressure levels are less than 140 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure is less than 90 mm Hg. In patients who have hypertension with diabetes or renal disease, the blood pressure goal is less than 130/80 mm Hg. However, the 2014 JNC-8 guidelines recommend more lenient targets (150/90 mm Hg in patients â‰¥60 y, and 140/90 mm Hg for most other populations).

### Diabetes

Blood pressure control is recommended in types 1 and 2 diabetes. Hypertensive agents that are useful in the diabetic population include ACE inhibitors or ARBs.

Treating adults with diabetes with statin therapy, especially patients with other risk factors, is recommended, and monotherapy with fibrates may also be considered to lower stroke risk. Taking aspirin is reasonable in patients who are at high cardiovascular disease risk. However, the benefit of taking aspirin in diabetic patients for the reduction of stroke risk has not been fully demonstrated.

### Dyslipidemia

Statin therapy is recommended in patients with coronary heart disease and certain high-risk conditions for the primary prevention of ischemic stroke. In addition to statin therapy, therapeutic lifestyle changes and LDL-cholesterol goals are also recommended.

Niacin may be used in patients with low HDL cholesterol or elevated lipoprotein (a), but its efficacy in preventing ischemic stroke is not established. Fibric acid derivatives, niacin, bile acid sequestrants, and ezetimibe may be useful in patients who have not achieved the target LDL-C level with statin therapy or who cannot tolerate statins; however, their effectiveness in reducing the risk of stroke has not been established.

### Diet and nutrition

A diet that is low in sodium and high in potassium is recommended to reduce blood pressure. Diets that promote the consumption of fruits, vegetables, and low-fat dairy products, such as the DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension)â€“style diet, help to lower blood pressure and may lower the risk of stroke.

### Physical activity

Increases in physical activity are associated with a reduction in the risk of stroke. The goal is to engage in at least 30 minutes of moderate intensity activity on a daily basis

### Obesity and body fat distribution

Weight reduction among persons who are overweight or obese is recommended to reduce blood pressure and risk of stroke.

### Sleep health

Care should be taken to ensure that patients with metabolic syndrome practice healthy sleep behaviors. Even in patients who do not have sleep apnea or suspected sleep apnea, some studies have suggested a relationship between sleep deprivation or inadequate sleep time and metabolic syndrome.[129] Shift workers, who tend to have poor quality sleep, may also be at higher risk of developing metabolic syndrome.

## Medication

## Medication Summary

An insulin-sensitizing agent, such as metformin, is typically used at the start of hyperglycemia treatment in patients with metabolic syndrome. Some literature suggests that metformin may help to reverse the pathophysiologic changes of metabolic syndrome. This includes when it is used in combination with lifestyle changes or with peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor agonists, such as fibrates and thiazolidinediones (eg, pioglitazone, rosiglitazone), each of which may produce favorable metabolic alterations as single agents in patients with metabolic syndrome.

When statin therapy and therapeutic lifestyle modifications are not successful, niacin may aid in the management of reduced HDL-C and in the treatment of elevated triglycerides.

Aspirin may contribute to the primary prevention of cardiovascular complications in metabolic syndrome, particularly in patients with at least an intermediate risk of suffering a cardiovascular event (ie, >6% 10-y risk).

Additional therapies have found early support from more recent data. For example, a small trial of high-dose resveratrol therapy (1000 mg daily) was found to lead to greater new bone formation and mineralization in men with metabolic syndrome.
