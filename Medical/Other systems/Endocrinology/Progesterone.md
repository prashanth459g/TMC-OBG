# Progesterone

## Physiology
[[Personale & History#Progesterone]]
#### Receptors 
- The major target organ of progesterone is the reproductive tract, however, progesterone has a systemic effect and influences other organs including, but not limited to: the mammary glands, the nervous system and the brain, the heart, the bone, the endocrine and the immune systems. In the reproductive system, progesterone, in association with estrogen, is involved in the development and sexual maturation of the reproductive organs and orchestrates the menstrual cycle.

| Tissue | Cell type |
| ------ | --------- |
|Uterus| Endometrium, Myometrium |Ovary| Luteinizing granulose, Preovulatory granulose, Corpus luteum, 
|Other reproductive organs |Vagina, Testes
|Breast |Ductal and lobular epithelial cells 
|Brain |Pituitary, Hypothalamus, Preoptic area 
|Others |Vascular endothelium, Thymus, Pancreatic islets, Osteoblast-like cells, Lung
#### MOA
- The genomic actions of progesterone are largely, but not only, mediated by the progesterone receptor (PR).
