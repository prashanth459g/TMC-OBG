# Physiological Changes in CVS during pregnancy
- 
	- ![[Pasted image 20220529211926.png]]

#### ANATOMICAL CHANGES: 
Due to elevation of the diaphragm consequent to the enlarged uterus, the heart is pushed upward and outward with slight rotation to left 
- Abnormal clinical findings: 
	- The displacement may, at times, be responsible for palpitation. 
	- The apex beat is shifted to the 4th intercostal space about 2.5 cm outside the midclavicular line. 
	- Pulse rate is slightly raised, often with extra-systoles.
	- A systolic murmur may be audible in the apical or pulmonary area. This is due to decreased blood viscosity and torsion of the great vessels. 
	- A continuous hissing murmur may be audible over the tricuspid area in the left second and third intercostal spaces called the “mammary murmur”. It is due to increased blood flow through the internal mammary vessels. 
	- Doppler echocardiography shows an increase in the left ventricular end diastolic diameters. The left and right atrial diameters also increase. 
	- A third heart sound (S3) due to rapid diastolic filling and rarely a fourth heart sound may be auscultated. 
	- ECG reveals normal pattern except evidences of left axis deviation.
- The physician should be familiar with these physiological findings and should execute a cautious approach in diagnosis of heart disease during pregnancy
#### CARDIAC OUTPUT: 
- The cardiac output (CO) starts to increase from 5th week of pregnancy and reaches its peak 40–50% at about 30–34 weeks. Thereafter the CO remains static till term when the observation is made at lateral recumbent position. 
- CO is lowest in the sitting or supine position and highest in the right or left lateral or knee chest position. 
- Cardiac output increases further during labor (+50%) and immediately following delivery (+70%) over the pre-labor values. 
- MAP also rises.
- There is squeezing out of blood from the uterus into the maternal circulation (**auto transfusion**) during labor and in the immediate postpartum. CO returns to pre-labor values by 1 hour following delivery and to the pre-pregnant level by another 4 weeks time.
- The increase in CO is caused by: (1) Increased blood volume. (2) To meet the additional O2 required due to increased metabolic activity during pregnancy. 
	- CO is the product of SV and HR (CO = SV × HR). The increase in CO is chiefly affected by increase in stroke volume and increase in pulse rate to about 15 per minute. 
	- A normal heart got enough reserve power to cope with the increased load but a damaged heart fails to do so.
#### BLOOD PRESSURE: 
- Systemic vascular resistance(SVR) decreases (–21%) due to smooth muscle relaxing effect of progesterone, NO, prostaglandins or ANP. 
- In spite of the large increase in cardiac output, the maternal BP (BP = CO × SVR) is decreased due to decrease in SVR. 
- There is overall decrease in diastolic blood pressure (BP) and mean arterial pressure (MAP) by 5–10 mm Hg. The decrease in maternal blood pressure parallels that of SVR.
#### VENOUS PRESSURE: 
- Antecubital venous pressure remains unaffected. 
- Femoral venous pressure is markedly raised especially in the later months. It is due to pressure exerted by the gravid uterus on the common iliac veins, more on the right side due to dextrorotation of the uterus. 
- The femoral venous pressure is raised from 8–10 cm of water in nonpregnant state to about 25 cm of water during pregnancy in lying down position and to about 80–100 cm of water in standing position. 
- This explains the fact that the physiological edema of pregnancy subsides by rest alone. 
- Distensibility of the veins and stagnation of blood in the venous system explain the development of edema, varicose veins, piles and deep vein thrombosis.
#### CENTRAL HEMODYNAMICS: 
- In pregnancy, there is no significant change in CVP, MAP and PCWP although there is increase in blood volume, cardiac output and heart rate. 
- The reasons are: there is significant fall in SVR, pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) and colloidal osmotic pressure.
#### SUPINE HYPOTENSION SYNDROME (POSTURAL HYPOTENSION): 
- During late pregnancy, the gravid uterus produces a compression effect on the inferior vena cava when the patient is in supine position. This, however, results in opening up of the collateral circulation by means of paravertebral and azygos veins. 
- In some cases (10%), when the collateral circulation fails to open up, the venous return of the heart may be seriously curtailed. This results in production of hypotension, tachycardia and syncope. The normal blood pressure is quickly restored by turning the patient to lateral position. 
- The augmentation of the venous return(**auto transfusion**) during uterine contraction prevents the manifestation from developing during labor.
#### REGIONAL DISTRIBUTION OF BLOOD FLOW: 
- Uterine blood flow is increased from 50 mL/min in nonpregnant state to about 750 mL near term. 
	- Nonpregnant uterus receives 2% of CO and breasts 1%. 
- Increase in blood flow going to the organs is about 50% due to overall increase in CO. The increase is due to the combined effect of uteroplacental and fetoplacental vasodilatation. 
- The vasodilatation is due to the smooth muscle relaxing effects of progesterone, estrogen, nitric oxide (endothelium derived factor), prostaglandins and atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP). In a normal pregnancy, vascular system becomes refractory to angiotensin II, endothelin I and other pressure agents. 
- Pulmonary blood flow (normal 6,000 mL/min) is increased by 2,500 mL/min. 
- Renal blood flow (normal 800 mL) increases by 400 mL/min at 16th week and remains at this level till term. 
- The blood flow through the skin and mucous membranes reaches a maximum of 500 mL/min by 36th week. 
- Heat sensation, sweating or stuffy nose complained by the pregnant women can be explained by the increased blood flow.





# Heart disease in pregnancy
#### INCIDENCE AND TYPES: 
- The incidence of cardiac lesion is less than 1% amongst hospital deliveries. 
- The commonest cardiac lesion is of rheumatic origin followed by the congenital ones.
- Rheumatic valvular lesion predominantly includes mitral stenosis (80%). 
- Predominant congenital lesions include patent ductus arteriosus, atrial or ventricular septal defect, pulmonary stenosis, coarctation of aorta and Fallot’s tetralogy. Rare causes are hypertensive, thyrotoxic, syphilitic or coronary cardiac diseases.
#### Heart lesion & Pregnency
- EFFECT OF CARDIOVASCULAR PHYSIOLOGY ON HEART LESION: [[Heart disease in pregnancy#Physiological Changes in CVS during pregnancy]]
	- Marked hemodynamic changes in pregnancy and cardiac output in particular, have profound effects on heart disease. 
	- A normal heart has got enough reserve power so that the extra load can well be tackled. While a damaged heart with good reserve can even withstand the strain but if the reserve is poor, cardiac failure occurs sooner or later. 
	- The cardiac failure occurs during pregnancy around 30 weeks, during labor and mostly soon following delivery. 
	- Factors responsible for cardiac failure: (1) Advanced age (2) Cardiac arrhythmias or left ventricular hypertrophy (3) History of previous heart failure (4) Appearance of “risk factors” in pregnancy are: infection, anemia, hypertension, excessive weight gain and multiple pregnancy (5) Inadequate supervision.
- EFFECTS OF HEART LESION ON PREGNANCY: 
	- There is a tendency of preterm delivery and prematurity. IUGR is quite common in cyanotic heart diseases.
#### Prognosis
- Maternal & Fetal outcomes
- Maternal: 
	- The prognosis depends on: (1) Nature of lesion (2) Functional capacity of the heart (3) Quality of medical supervision provided during pregnancy, labor and puerperium (4) Presence of other risk factors mentioned earlier (5) Whether patient has undergone corrective surgery or not.
	- Maternal mortality is lowest in rheumatic heart lesions and acyanotic group of heart diseases—less than 1%. 
	- With elevation of pulmonary vascular resistance especially with cyanotic heart lesions, the mortality may be raised to even 50% (Eisenmenger’s syndrome). 
	- *Most of the deaths occur due to cardiac failure* and the `maximum deaths occur following birth`. 
		- The other causes of death are—(a) pulmonary edema (b) pulmonary embolism (c) active rheumatic carditis (d) subacute bacterial endocarditis and (e) rupture of cerebral aneurysm in coarctation of aorta.
	- However, with improved medical care, surgical correction of the congenital lesions and better obstetric care, the maternal mortality has been reduced markedly. 
	- Pregnancy however, does not affect the long-term survival of a woman with rheumatic heart lesion provided she survives pregnancy itself.
- Fetal: 
	- In rheumatic heart lesions, the fetal outcome is usually good and in no way different from the patients without any heart lesion. 
	- However, in cyanotic group of heart lesion, there is increased fetal loss(45%) due to abortion, IUGR and prematurity. 
	- Fetal congenital cardiac disease is increased by 3–10% if either of the parents have congenital lesions.
#### Diagnosis:

> - Anatomical and Physiological Changes During Pregnancy that Mimic Cardiac Disease
> 	-  Hyperdynamic circulation
> 	- Systolic ejection murmur at left sternal border (due to increased blood flow across the aortic and pulmonary valves)
> 	- Dyspnea, decreased exercise tolerance, fatigue, syncope
> 	- Tachycardia, shift of ventricular apex
> 	- Continuous murmur at 2nd to 4th intercostal space - mammary souffle
> 	- Loud first sound with splitting
> - Symptoms must be carefully assessed and investigations are to be done to confirm the diagnosis

- Diagnosis of Heart Disease in Pregnancy
	- Symptoms: Breathlessness, nocturnal cough,syncope, chest pain
	- Signs: Chest murmurs—pansystolic, late systolic, louder ejection systolic or diastolic associated with a thrill.
	- Cardiac enlargement, arrhythmia
	- Chest radiography (using lead shield): Cardiomegaly, increased pulmonary vascular markings, enlargement of pulmonary veins.
	- Electrocardiography: T wave inversion, biatrial enlargement, dysrhythmias
	- Echocardiography (color flow Doppler study): Structural abnormalities (ASD, VSD), valve anatomy, valve area, function, left ventricular ejection fraction, pulmonary artery systolic pressure 
	- Cardiac MRI can delineate complex (anatomy when it is not well-evaluated by echocardiography)

#### Classification's
##### NYHA - Functional classification
- New York Heart Association (NYHA) #Classification/NYHA  of Heart Disease (Depending Upon the Cardiac Response to Physical Activity)
	- grade-i: Uncompromised and no limitation of physical activity
	- grade-ii: Slightly compromised with slight limitation of physical activity. The patients are comfortable at rest but ordinary physical activity causes discomfort
	- grade-iii: Markedly compromised with marked limitation of activity. The patients are comfortable at rest but discomfort occurs with less than ordinary activity
	- grade-iv: Severely compromised with discomfort even at rest
`Limitation: This classification has considered the symptoms only but not the anatomical type and severity of pathology.It does not predict pregnancy outcome`
- The first step in the pre-conceptional counselling session is to obtain a thorough history, perform a physical examination, and have available information from recent electrocardiograms and echocardiograms. This information will make it possible to obtain a functional classification and to place the patient in a risk category

##### Risk for cardiac events during 🤰 
- The evaluation of risk provides a basis to explain to the patient the need for extensive testing during pregnancy, increased frequency of office visits, need for prolonged hospitalization, and in some cases the need for surgical or medical procedures before pregnancy. Risk assessment is also useful to determine the type of facility where the patient should go for her delivery. Women with complex anatomic lesions and at moderate and high risk for complications should be counselled to deliver in tertiary centers

###### mWHO
![[Modified-WHO-classification-of-maternal-cardiovascular-risk-application.png]]

#### General Management:
- Principals 
	- Early diagnosis and evaluation of anatomical type and functional grade of the case.
	- To detect the high risk factors and to prevent cardiac failure.
	- Multidisciplinary team approach (obstetrician, cardiologist and neonatologist) and mandatory hospital delivery.
![[Pasted image 20230516035745.png]]
- Therapeutic Termination: Considering high maternal deaths, 
	- absolute indications are (a) primary pulmonary hypertension (b) Eisenmenger’s syndrome and (c) pulmonary veno-occlusive disease.
	- Relative indications are—(a) Parous woman with grade III and IV cardiac lesions (b) Grade I or II with previous history of cardiac failure in early months or in between pregnancy.
	- The termination should be done **within 12 weeks** by suction evacuation (MVA) or by conventional D & E.

- Antenatal care: 
	- Risk stratification and recommend care
		- ![[Pasted image 20230416155010.png]]
	- The patients with heart disease should be supervised in a tertiary care hospital. The initial assessment should be made in consultation with a cardiologist. 
	- Injection penidure (benzathine penicillin) is given at intervals of 4 weeks throughout pregnancy and puerperium to prevent recurrence of rheumatic fever. 
	- Counseling is to be done regarding prognosis and risks.
	- ==Special care in each antenatal visit is to detect and to treat the risk factors that precipitate cardiac failure in pregnancy==. 
		- Risk factors for cardiac failure are:
			- Infections—Urinary tract, dental and respiratory tract.
			- Anemia 
			- Obesity 
			- Hypertension 
			- Arrhythmias 
			- Hyperthyroidism 
			- Drugs - Betamimetics.
			- Dietary indiscretion: Excess intake of caffeine, alcohol, high calorie diet, excess salt.

- Role of Anticoagulant's:
	- Anticoagulants are indicated in cases with: (a) Congenital heart disease, (b) pulmonary hypertension,(c) mechanical heart valve, (d) atrial fibrillation. 
	- The patient taking warfarin should discontinue it as soon as pregnancy is diagnosed and to replace it by heparin 5,000 units twice daily subcutaneously up to *12th week*. low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) can also be used. 
	- This is then replaced by warfarin tablet 3 mg. daily to be taken at the same time each day and continued up to *36 weeks*. 
	- Thereafter it is replaced by heparin up to *7 days postpartum*. Warfarin is then to be continued.
	- UFH, lMWH and Warfarin therapy do not contraindicate breast-feeding.

- Indications for cardiac surgery in pregnancy are: 
	- Failure of medical treatment for: (i) Intolerable symptoms (ii) Intractable cardiac failure

- ADMISSION: 
	- Elective:
		- Grade–I : At least 2 weeks prior to the expected date of delivery
		- Grade–II : At 28th week especially in case of unfavorable social surroundings
		- Grade III and IV : As soon as pregnancy is diagnosed. The patient should be kept in the hospital throughout pregnancy.
	- Emergency: 
		1. Deterioration of the functional grading
		2. Appearance of dyspnea or cough or basal crepitations or tachyarrhythmias 
		3. Appearance of any pregnancy complication like anemia, preeclampsia.

- Management during Labor
	- ? INDUCTION: 
		- Most patients with cardiac disease go into spontaneous labor and deliver without any difficulty. 
		- However, induction (vaginal PGE2) may be employed in very selected cases for obstetric indications. 
		- One should guard against infection and pulmonary edema due to fluid overload.
	- LABOR: 
		- First stage:
			- Position: The patient should be in lateral recumbent position to minimize aortocaval compression
			- Oxygen is to be administered (5–6 L/min) if required
			- Analgesia in the majority, is best given by epidural
			- Prophylactic antibiotics against bacterial endocarditis
			- Fluids should not be infused more than 75 ml/hour to prevent pulmonary edema.
			- Careful watch of the pulse and respiration rate. 
				- If the pulse rate exceeds 110 per minute in between uterine contractions, rapid digitalization is done by intravenous digoxin 0.5 mg.
			- Cardiac monitoring and pulse oximetry can detect arrhythmias and hypoxemia early.
			- Central venous pressure monitoring may be needed in selected cases.
		- Prophylactic antibiotics for bacterial endocarditis: 
			- Antibiotic prophylaxis during labor and 48 hours after delivery is considered appropriate. This is to prevent bacterial endocarditis. 
			- The recommended regimens include intravenous ampicillin 2 g and gentamicin 1.5 mg/kg (not to exceed 80 mg), at the onset or induction of labor followed by repeat doses 8 hours interval. 
			- High risk patients are: (a) Structural heart disease (b) Rheumatic heart disease (c) Cyanotic congenital heart disease (d) Presence of dental and respiratory tract infections (e) Hypertrophic cardiac myopathy (f ) Prosthetic heart valves (g) Prior history of infective endocarditis (h) Cardiac transplant.
		- Second stage: 
			- No maternal pushing and the tendency to delay in the second stage of labor is to be curtailed by forceps or ventouse under pudendal and/or perineal block anesthesia. 
			- Ventouse is preferable to forceps as it can be applied without putting the patient in lithotomy position (raising the legs increases the cardiac load). 
			- Intravenous ergometrine with the delivery of the anterior shoulder should be withheld to prevent sudden overloading of the heart by the additional blood squeezed out from the uterus.
		- Third stage: 
			- Conventional management is to be followed. Slight blood loss is not detrimental but if it is in excess, oxytocin can be given by infusion. This may be accompanied by aggressive diuresis by IV frusemide. 
			- It is better to administer oxytocin in preference to ergometrine in all cases of heart disease in third stage.
- C section
	- PLACE OF CESAREAN SECTION: In general, there is no indication of cesarean section for heart disease.
	- CARDIAC INDICATIONS OF CESAREAN DELIVERY: 
		- Coarctation of aorta
		- Aortic dissection or aneurysm 
		- Aortopathy with aortic root > 4 cm 
		- Warfarin treatment within 2 weeks
	- In coarctation of aorta, elective cesarean section is indicated to prevent rupture of the aorta or mycotic cerebral aneurysm. The anesthesia should be given by expert anesthetist using either epidural (preferred) or general anesthesia.

- Puerperium:
	- The patient is to be observed closely for the first 24 hours. Oxygen is administered. Hourly pulse, BP and respiration are recorded. Diuretic may be used if there is volume overload.
	- Breastfeeding is not contraindicated unless there is failure. Anticoagulant therapy is not a contraindication of breastfeeding.

- Contraception's : 
	- Steroidal contraception is avoided as it may cause thromboembolic phenomenon.
	- Intrauterine device (copper IUCD or LNG-IUS) is often avoided for fear of infection though WHO permits its use. 
	- Progestin only pills or parenteral progestins are safe and effective. They may cause irregular bleeding especially if the patient is anticoagulated. 
	- Barrier method of contraceptives (condom) is the best. 
	- Sterilization should be considered with the completion of the family at the end of first week in the puerperium under local anesthesia through abdominal route by minilap technique. 
	- If the heart is not well compensated, the husband is advised for vasectomy.

- Management of cardiac failure in pregnancy: 
	- The principles of management are the same as in nonpregnant state. 
	- A cardiologist should be involved. Underlying pathophysiology and the cause of failure must be understood.
		- Propped up position 
		- O2 administration 
		- Monitoring with ECG and pulse oximetry
		- Diuretic: Frusemide (Loop) (40–80 mg) IV (anticipatory aggressive diuresis is needed to avoid pulmonary congestion)
		- Mechanical ventilation 
		- Injection morphine 15 mg IM
		- Digoxin 0.5 mg IM followed by tab digoxin 0.25 mg P.O. (Digoxin crosses the placenta and is excreted in breast milk)
		- Dysrhythmias—quinidine or electrical cardioversion
		- Tachyarrhythmias—Adenosine (3–12 mg) IV or DC conversion

- Predictors of adverse maternal outcomes :
	- Prior cardiac failure, arrhythmia or transient ischemic attack 
	- Baseline NYHA class > 2 or associated cyanosis
	- Left heart obstruction: Mitral valve area < 2 cm2, aortic valve area < 1.5 cm2, or peak ventricular outflow gradient > 30 mm Hg by echocardiography
	- Left ventricular ejection fraction < 40%.
#### Specific Heart disease's management in pregnancy
##### Rheumatic heart disease
- MITRAL STENOSIS: 
	- Mitral stenosis is the commonest heart lesion met during pregnancy. 
	- Normal mitral valve area ranges between 4 and 6 cm2. 
	- Symptoms usually appear when stenosis narrows this to less than 2.5 cm2. 
	- Women with mitral valve area ≤1 cm2, have the high rate of pulmonary edema (55%) and arrhythmia (33%). 
	- In asymptomatic cases, the mortality is < 1% but once it is significantly symptomatic, mortality ranges between 5% and 15%.
- Diagnosis and management has been mentioned earlier. *During labor continuous **epidural analgesia** is ideal and intravenous fluid overload is to be avoided.*
- PLACE OF VALVOTOMY: 
	- It is better to withheld elective cardiac surgery during pregnancy. Surgery should be considered in cases of unresponsive failure with pregnancy beyond 12 weeks. 
	- Best time of surgery is between 14 weeks and 18 weeks. 
	- Valve replacement, commissurotomy, balloon valvotomy can be carried out in early second trimester. 
	- Atrial fibrillation is a complication. Digoxin, β blockers and anticoagulation (heparin) should be used.
- AORTIC STENOSIS: 
	- Most cases of aortic stenosis are congenital, some are rheumatic in origin. 
	- Normal aortic valve area is 3–4 cm2. When it is reduced to less than or equal to 1 cm2, stenosis is significant. Maternal mortality of significant aortic stenosis is about 15–20% with perinatal loss of about 30%. 
	- Epidural anesthesia is contraindicated.
	- During labor, *fluid therapy (125–150 ml/h) should ==not be restricted==*. 
	- Left ventricular after load is high and the pregnant patient is sensitive to hemorrhage.
	- Common symptoms are angina, syncope and left ventricular failure. Medical management is not helpful in a symptomatic patient. Valve replacement is the definitive treatment. Mechanical valves need anticoagulation. Open heart surgery is preferably avoided in pregnancy. Aortic balloon valvuloplasty may be done as a palliative procedure.
##### CONGENITAL HEART DISEASE: 
- With increasing number of surgical correction of the congenital heart lesions from infancy to adulthood, more and more pregnancies with congenital lesions are met in day-to-day practice.
- These patients pose little problem in obstetrics. But when pregnancy occurs in uncorrected congenital lesions, problems are very much there especially in a cyanotic group. 
- Risk to the offspring of congenital heart disease is high (3–13%). 
- Major maternal risks in pregnancy are: (i) Cyanosis (ii) Left ventricular dysfunction and (iii) Pulmonary hypertension. 
- The common maternal complications are: (i) Congestive cardiac failure (ii) Pulmonary edema (iii)Arrhythmia and (iv) Hypertension. All women should have fetal echocardiography examination at mid pregnancy.
###### Acyanotic (L to R shunt)
1. Atrial Septal Defect (ASD): 
	- ASD (ostium secundum type) is the most common congenital heart lesion during pregnancy. 
	- Even uncorrected ASD tolerates pregnancy and labor well. 
	- Congestive cardiac failure unresponsive to medical therapy requires surgical correction. 
	- Shunt reversal is the major risk which may develop in hypovolemia. 
		- Such cases may occur in hemorrhagic conditions and following injudicious administration of epidural anesthesia.
	- In the absence of arrhythmias, and pulmonary hypertension, ASD does not usually complicate pregnancy.
2. Patent Ductus Arteriosus (PDA): 
	- Presence of continuous murmur at the upper left sternal border is suggestive of diagnosis. 
	- Most patients with PDA tolerate pregnancy well. 
	- Pulmonary hypertension may cause maternal death.
	- Surgical correction during pregnancy can be performed provided there is no pulmonary hypertension. 
	- Epidural analgesia is better avoided to minimize shunt reversal due to systemic hypotension. 
	- Fetal loss may be up to 7% and there is 4% chance that the child of this parent will suffer from the same abnormality. 
	- Endocarditis prophylaxis should be given.
3. Ventricular Septal Defect (VSD): 
	- In general, if the defect is less than 1.25 cm2, pulmonary hypertension and heart failure do not develop. 
	- Pregnancy is well tolerated with small to moderate left to right shunt or with moderate pulmonary hypertension. 
	- The major risk is shunt reversal leading to circulatory collapse and cyanosis. 
	- Hypotension is to be avoided. Fetal loss may be up to 20%.
4. Mitral Valve Prolapse (MVP): Is the commonest congenital valvular lesion. Most of them are asymptomatic. Women tolerate pregnancy and labor well. Endocarditis prophylaxis is given.
###### Cyanotic (R to L shunt)
- Fallot’s tetralogy: 
	- It is the most common form of cyanotic heart lesion. It is a combination of (a) ventricular septal defect, (b) pulmonary valve stenosis, (c) right ventricular hypertrophy and (d) an overriding aorta. 
	- After surgical correction, patients tolerate pregnancy well. Surgically uncorrected patients are at increased risk. 
	- Complications like bacterial endocarditis, brain abscess and cerebral embolism are more common. 
	- Maternal mortality is 5–10% and the perinatal mortality is 30–40%. IUGR is common. 
	- Systemic hypotension is dangerous which may lead even to death. 
	- Epidural or spinal anesthesia is avoided. 
	- Pregnancy is discouraged in women with uncorrected tetralogy.
- Eisenmenger’s syndrome: 
	- Patients with Eisenmenger’s syndrome have pulmonary hypertension with shunt (right to left) through an open ductus, an atrial or ventricular septal defect. 
	- Maternal mortality is about 50% and so also the perinatal loss (50%). 
	- Termination of pregnancy should be seriously considered. 
	- Heparin should be used throughout pregnancy as there is risk of systemic and pulmonary thromboembolism. 
	- Epidural anesthesia is contraindicated. 
	- Inhaled nitric oxide or I.V. prostacyclin is used as a pulmonary vasodilator. 
	- To maintain hemodynamic stability, pulmonary artery catheter and a peripheral artery catheter are used. 
	- Complications are: CCF, hemoptysis, arrhythmia, cerebrovascular accident and hypoxemia; hyperviscosity syndrome and sudden death.
###### Other congenital heart lesions
- Coarctation of aorta: 
	- The maternal risks are hypertension, aortic dissection, bacterial endocarditis and cerebral hemorrhage due to ruptured intracranial aneurysms. 
	- Maternal mortality is high 3–9%. Fetal loss is also increased to 25%. 
	- Surgical correction should be done prior to pregnancy. 
	- Termination of pregnancy should be seriously considered. 
	- Elective cesarean section is preferred to minimize dissection associated with labor.

- Primary pulmonary hypertension 
	- is characterized by increased thickening of muscular layer of pulmonary arterioles. The cause remains unknown. 
	- Maternal mortality is about 50%, majority die (75%) postpartum. The fetal outlook is also gloomy. 
	- Termination of pregnancy is indicated. 
		- Bed rest should be imposed from 20 weeks of pregnancy. Anticoagulant (heparin) is administered. 
		- Sildenafil is used as a potent vasodilator as it increases endogenous nitric oxide. Oral nifedipine or I.V. prostacyclin helps pulmonary vasodilatation. 
		- Epidural morphine gives effective analgesia without any hemodynamic change. 
	- Women with pulmonary hypertension and right ventricular dysfunction are strongly discouraged to become pregnant.
- Marfan’s syndrome: 
	- Marfan’s syndrome is an autosomal dominant condition. There is 50% chance of transmission to the offspring. 
	- Dilatation of aorta more than 40 mm as evidenced from echocardiography is a contraindication of pregnancy. 
	- Beta blocking drugs should be used to maintain resting heart rate around 70 bpm.
	- Hypertension should be avoided to prevent aortic dissection. 
	- Vaginal delivery is desirable with shortening of second stage. 
	- When the aortic root diameter measures more than 4 cm, mortality increases to 25%. 
	- Women with aortic diameter more than 5.5 cm should have graft and valve replacement before pregnancy.

- Prosthetic valves are used for significant valvular disease. 
	- Mechanical valves are durable but require anticoagulation. 
	- The risk of thromboembolism is high with low molecular weight heparin rather than warfarin.
	- Bioprosthetic valves (Porcine) are superior to mechanical valves. 

##### Cardiomyopathies
- Peripartum cardiomyopathy: 
	- Important diagnostic criteria are: 
		1. Cardiac failure within last month of pregnancy or within 5 months postpartum.
		2. No determinable cause for failure. 
		3. Absence of previous heart disease. 
		4. Left ventricular dysfunction as evidenced on echocardiography
			1. Ejection fraction less than 45% and 
			2. Left ventricular end diastolic dimension more than 2.7 cm/m2. 
	- Peripartum cardiomyopathy is a diagnosis of exclusion. 
		- The patients are usually multiparous and young (20–35 years). 
		- They complain of weakness, shortness of breath, cough, nocturnal dyspnea and palpitation. 
		- Examination reveals—tachycardia, arrhythmia, peripheral edema and pulmonary rales. 
	- Pregnancy is poorly tolerated in women with dilated cardiomyopathy.
	- The treatment is bed rest, digoxin, diuretics (preload reduction), hydralazine or ACE inhibitors (postpartum)(afterload reduction), β blocker and anticoagulant therapy. 
	- Vaginal delivery is preferred. 
	- Epidural anesthesia is ideal. 
	- There is no contraindication of breastfeeding. 
	- Mortality is high (20–50%)—due to CCF, arrhythmia or thromboembolism. It may recur in subsequent pregnancies.
- Myocardial infarction 
	- is rare in pregnancy. 
	- Management is mostly as in nonpregnant state. Coronary angioplasty, stenting and thrombolytic therapy have been done in pregnancy when indicated. Supine position and hypotension should be avoided. 
	- Labor: 
		- managed as with standard cardiac care. 
		- Elective delivery within two weeks of infarction should be avoided. 
		- Regional analgesia for pain in labor and β blockers for tachycardia may be used. 
		- Maternal pushing is avoided and second stage is shortened by forceps or vacuum. 
		- Syntocinon should be used in the third stage management as ergometrine may cause coronary artery spasm. 
	- Diuretics to be used postpartum. 
	- Percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty can be done successfully around 36 weeks of pregnancy if needed.
