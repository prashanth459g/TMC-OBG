# AFLP 

- It was described by Shihan way back in 1940 as Obstetric acute liver entropy. 
	- Just look at the prefix obstetrics. So very specifically, it was identified that this is a unique disorder that you can find in pregnancy. So way back almost 80 years ago, it was diagnosed that this condition is specific to pregnancy
- It is fortunately a rare event. 1 in 7000 to 1 in 20,000 pregnancies. 
	- Why I am telling it for that it is a fortunate thing, because it is potentially a lethal condition, potentially a lethal condition. And the risk of maternal mortality and perinatal mortality are very significant. 
- So there are some predisposing factors. 
	- It has been found to be more frequent association with Primi Gravida, multiple pregnancies(20%) also. in low body mass index women 
	- women with male fetuses are having an increased risk (ratio 3:1) 
- Pathogenesis 
	- I told you it has a high mortality rate of almost 10 to 20% (mostly because of disseminated intravascular coagulation, multi organ system failures(renal failure, massive hemorrhage) for mother & perinatal 
		- one of the important structure that can fail and cause the woman to die would be an acute renal failure. 
	- AFLP has been linked to defects in fatty acid metabolism. 
		- should be regarded as part of systemic mitochondrial dysfunction which could affect liver, kidneys, nervous system, pancreas and muscles. 
		- this particular condition has a predilection for liver and can involve other organs and present with varied kind of symptoms and size. 
		- ==Etiology== has been blamed Heterozygosity for **LCHAD** (long chain 3 hydroxy acyl coenzyme A dehydrogenase). So the deficiency of LCHAD is a disorder of mitochondrial *fatty acid oxidation*. 
			- By chance, this condition is present in the fetus. LCHAD deficiency, which is heterozygous in the mother, is going to be the cause of AFLP and [[HELLP]] takes a very bad course in women whose Fetus has got a homozygosity for this same enzyme. 
- The mitochondrial cytopathies are marked by. -> symptomatology
	- Vomiting and weakness is a common feature of these conditions. 
	- Lactic acidosis and metabolic acidosis, or because of the defects in oxidative phosphorylation. 
	- And there is defective Krebs cycle and also the citric acid cycle function. 
		- So citric acid cycle function is going to cause **hypoglycemia** and the Krebs cycle deficiency is going to cause **hyper-ammonia**.

### Workup
- CT scan may show decreased attenuation due to infiltration with fat. 
- MRI may show normal liver or steatosis
- USG is normal -> because the steatosis in the cells is micro vesicular -> does not pick it up by ultrasound but will be picked up by the CT or MRI. So CT or MRI is a better mode of investigation. If you want to diagnose AFLP by imaging 
- HPR -> picture is micro vesicular and macro vesicular fat droplets with balloon hepatocytes. You have got huge hepatocytes and the hepatocytes have got both micro vesicular and macro vesicular fat droplet deposited in cells.
	- so how do we diagnose you need a liver biopsy? 
	- You know, the commonest association with AFLP be coagulation profile failure. So one of the contraindication for lever biopsy would be failure coagulation profile. So can I really attempt to do a liver biopsy in these patients? 
	- Periportal area is relatively spared. 
	- microvacuoles may be clearly recognized only on fresh sections stained with fat specific methods
- biopsy is not necessary for the diagnosis for the above said 
- the best markers of ==severity== in  AFLP are : Prothrombin time, Serum lactate, Serum glucose
- This is a condition more uniquely found in the 3rd trimester, very close to this term, though it is having a gradual onset of nausea, vomiting and lethargy. It just progresses very fast. 
	- Severe vomiting and abdominal pain are present in almost 60% of the cases. 
	- Severe vomiting. A third trimester woman comes to you with pain of the man and severe vomiting. Just don't dismiss that this could be a case of gastritis or something else. Please keep the option of aflp also in these cases
	- It could be associated with mild preeclampsia, multiple pregnancy and primary gravity 
	- Jaundice usually appears in around 2 weeks. It is not the initial presentation. You may get it later and there may be ascites
	- There is a *moderate* elevation of AST and ALT about three to 10 times. 
		- Why I am telling moderate elevation is you have mild and severe elevations. Mild elevation is usually seen in cases preeclampsia, whereas marked elevation to the tune of 3000 to 4000 which amounts to almost hundred times you can see it in hepatitis. 
		- Whereas here in AFLP it can get increased with the tune of 3 to 10 times and the maximum is around 20 times 
	- even the alkaline phosphatase also is raised. 
	- DIC(90%) is often the presenting feature :- *PT APTT Prolonged & Fibrinogen decreased* profile. 
	- Acute kidney injury is another feature. 
	- So there could be lactic acidosis and ammonia is raised which is again as a result of the failure of detoxification *uric acid level would be high* 
	- Woman can go for fulminant hepatic failure and starts showing the science and symptoms of hepatic encephalopathy -> spider nevi, flapping tremors then altered sensorium
	- pancreatitis is one more grave association -> liver problem itself is going to be detrimental to the woman, if you have an associated pancreatitis, the prognosis still worsens 
	- hypoglycemia is present in 70% of the women very common association ==recurrent attacks of hypoglycemia== and we attributed it to the citric acid cycle problems in the mitochondria. Thus the hypoglycemic episodes could be sometimes the feature which kills the woman also. 
	- There may be polyurea polydipsia which are the features of diabetes insipidus.
	- leukocytosis and thrombocytopenia are the other features look clear. DIC also associated with thrombocytopenia. 
	- How risky is the situation if she delivers if there is PPH, you have absolutely nothing to manage these women 
		- so biopsy or the imaging are not very, very important in diagnosing or not that helpful in diagnosing AFLP.

### Swansea Criteria
- it is a  consensus criteria called Swansea Criteria which is about 14 in number. If the woman shows >5/14 features then you make a diagnosis of acute fatty liver pregnancy. 
	1. vomiting 
	2. abdominal pain
	3. 60% of the cases polydipsia and polyurea 
	4. signs and symptoms of encephalopathy
	5. hyperbilirubinemia >0.8 mg/dl. 
	6. hypoglycemia <72 mg/dl
	7. uric acid >5.7mg/dl
	8. leukocytosis >11,000 /dl
	10. AST & ALT >42 IU/l
	11. ammonia >27.5 mg/dl
	12. Creatinine >1.7mg/dl
	13. coagulopathy with PT >14 sec or APTT >34 sec
	9. ascites or bright liver on sonogram
	14. micro vesicular steatosis on liver biopsy
- Most of them are either clinical or biochemical though there is one ultrasound feature and also there is one biopsy feature keeping them aside. You have around 12 of which 50% or fulfilled your diagnosis of AFLP is done right. 

### Differential diagnosis
`AFLP` vs `Hepatitis`  vs `IHCP` vs `Severe PE`
- Hepatitis - all the three others are specifically found in pregnancy, but viral hepatitis can come at anytime during the pregnancy because it's only an associated disorder. 
	- similar presentation with raised bilirubin, markedly elevated AST ALT
	- No recurrence
- IHCP - 3rd Trimester 
	- Pruritis, mild jaundice
	- mildly elevated AST ALT, moderately elevated ALP, elevated Bile acids
	- 90% - highly recurrent
- Severe PE - after 20 week
	- Hypertension, proteinuria, impending eclampsia
	- slight or moderate increase in bilirubin, AST, ALT, LDH
	- 25-50% recurrence
- AFLP - 3rd Trimester 
	- Rapid progression 
	- Adverse outcome common with multiorgan failure
	- bilirubin elevated, ALT AST minimal elevation, normal ALP
	- recurrence can occur

### Management 
- always multidisciplinary intensive care unit management 1 to 1 nursing care is very important in improving the outcomes 
- regular vitals monitoring establish the central Venus line before she develops DIC picture 
- investigations are so frequently done 
	- hypoglycemia is so frequent 70% cases. So every two hours keep doing the random blood sugar
	- once in six hours, look for the evidence of the coagulation failure, renal failure and worsening of the liver conditions. 
- Expedite delivery if condition is deteriorating. If she is showing some good improvement, you can plan to continue pregnancy. But if she is showing any deterioration in these investigations, better you plan about terminating the pregnancy. 
- Hypoglycemia is managed by giving high percentage of glucose 10%-50% and you may have to manage hyperglycemia 
- Encephalopathy should be diagnosed as early as possible in the very early stage and there is no specific treatment for encephalopathy. We have to probably just sterilize the gut and see that the absorption of proteins is and protein breakdown and formation of ammonia could be to some extent prevented. 
	- antibiotics to decolonize the gut like neomycin/tazosin could be used. 
- FFP and Vit K should be considered for coagulopathy
- lactic acidosis and metabolic acidosis should be very energetically corrected. 
- ? If the urine output is very heavy >400 mill per hour, sodium level >140, osmolality is >290mOsmol/L. That is hemoconcentration happening in such cases better to give intra nasal desmopressin. 
- Acute kidney injury may require dialysis and nephro toxic drugs in those cases should be avoided and in general hepatotoxic drugs also should be avoided. 
- And you know, LCHAD, we said that deficiency is the cause. probably orthostatic level transplantation have to be considered a woman as one for irreversible liver damage and also. The patients who are going for fulminant conditions
- PPH may require surgical interventions. May require hysterectomy. You may require vascular ligations, transfusion, because we plan so many transfusions in the long run after some time, she may develop some transfusion related issues and but if she recovers from this AFLP, there is no long term sequel associated with AFLP
