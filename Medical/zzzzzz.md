## Johnsons formula to calculate fetal weight using fundal height
- Johnson's formula for estimation of Foetal weight in vertex presentation is as follows: **Foetal weight (g)=fH (cm)n × 155**. 
	- fH=fundal height and n=12 if vertex is above ischial spine or 11 if vertex is below ischial spine. 
	- If a patient weighs more than 91 kg, 1 cm is subtracted from the fundal height.
