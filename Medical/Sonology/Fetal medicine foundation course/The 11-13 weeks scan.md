# The 11-13 weeks scan
- The traditional method of screening for Down’s syndrome has been maternal age where amniocentesis or chorionic villous sampling is offered to women aged 35 years or more. This results in the need for an invasive test in 15-20% of pregnant women with a detection of less than half of the fetuses with Down’s syndrome, because the majority of affected fetuses come from the younger age group
- A more effective method of screening is based in the combination of:
	-   Maternal age
	-   A maternal blood sample for the measurement of the placental products of free ß-hCG and PAPP-A
	-   An ultrasound scan at 11-13 weeks:
		-   to measure the collection of fluid behind the fetal neck (nuchal translucency)
		-   to examine the fetal nose and palate
		-   to measure the fetal heart rate
		-   to assess the flow of blood across the tricuspid valve of the fetal heart and the ductus venosus
- This new method of screening reduces dramatically the number of women requiring an invasive test from about 20% to less than 3% and at the same time increases the detection rate of Down’s syndrome and other major chromosomal abnormalities from less than 50% to more than 95%
- Other benefits of the 11–13 weeks scan include:
	-   Accurate dating of the pregnancy
	-   Early diagnosis of many major fetal abnormalities
	-   The detection of multiple pregnancies with reliable diagnosis of chorionicity, which is the main determinant of the outcome in multiple pregnancies
	-   Another recent development is that the 11-13 weeks scan can be used to identify women at increased risk for the development of preeclampsia in pregnancy
- Although there are many benefits from the 11-13 weeks scan it is essential that those undertaking this examination have a good knowledge of the diagnostic features and management of the conditions identified by this scan are adequately trained to perform the scan to a high standard, and their results are subjected to ongoing quality assurance based on the distribution of their measurements and examination of a sample of their images
# Screening for chromosomal defects
## General principles
-   **Every woman has a risk** that her fetus/baby has a chromosomal defect.
-   **The _a priori_ risk** depends on maternal age and gestation.
-   **The patient-specific risk** is calculated by multiplying the _a priori_ risk with a series of likelihood ratios, which depend on the results of a series of screening tests.
-   The likelihood ratio for a given sonographic or biochemical measurement is calculated by dividing the percentage of chromosomally abnormal fetuses by the percentage of normal fetuses with that measurement.
-   Every time a test is carried out the _a priori_ risk is multiplied by the likelihood ratio of the test to calculate a new risk, which then becomes the _a priori_ risk for the next test.
-   If the tests are not independent of each other then more sophisticated techniques, involving multivariate statistics, can be used to calculate the combined likelihood ratio.
## Maternal age
### Risk for trisomy 21
-   Increases with maternal age.
-   Decreases with gestational age because about 30% of affected fetuses die between the 12th and 40th week of pregnancy.
- **For example**, in a woman who is 35 years old the risk for trisomy 21 at the 12th week of pregnancy is 1 in 250, but the chance that she will deliver an affected baby at 40 weeks is 1 in 350. ![[Pasted image 20221203102339.png]]
### Other aneuploides
- **The risk for trisomies 18 and 13** increases with maternal age and decreases with gestation. The rate of fetal death between the 12th and 40th week is about 80%.
- **Turner syndrome** is unrelated to maternal age. The rate of fetal death between the 12th and 40th week is about 80%. The prevalence is about 1 in 1500 at 12 weeks and 1 in 4000 at 40 weeks.
- **Triploidy** is unrelated to maternal age. The prevalence at 12 weeks is about 1 in 2000 but it is highly lethal and is very rarely observed in live births.
