- **The Procedure**
	- The skin is prepared with a solution that reduces the risk of wound infection
	- A catheter is placed in the bladder
	- The hair near the incision may be shaved
	- An incision is made in the skin and is carried through the abdominal wall to enter the pelvis. The skin incision may be made vertical (up and down) or transverse (from side-to-side).

		- The decision is based on many factors including speed of entry, exposure needed, anticipated weight of the baby and risk of wound infection. 
		- A transverse skin incision is most common and is usually made 2-3 centimeters (one inch) above the pubic bone (Figure A)
	- The uterus is then identified. There is a layer of thin tissue, which drapes over the anterior surface of the uterus and then onto the bladder (the vesicouterine peritoneum). 
		- This layer is incised so that the bladder can be retracted away form the uterus to allow for the uterine incision. 
		- (Figure B) ![[Pasted image 20220213160300.png]]
		- The incision is then carried into the uterus to allow for delivery of the baby
	- The uterine incision is then made down to the amniotic sack (fetal membranes or bag of water). 
		- (Figure C)![[Pasted image 20220213160320.png]]
		- The uterine incision can be either transverse or vertical. Ninety percent have a transverse uterine incision. 
		- Some indications for a vertical incision in the uterus are a pre-term fetus, a fetus that is not head down and with emergency C-sections. Even in these situations a transverse incision may sometimes be used. A woman that has a prior C-section with a vertical uterine incision is usually not a candidate for vaginal birth
	- The fetal head or buttocks are then delivered through the uterine incision followed by the rest of the body. 
		- (Figure D) Then the is delivered![[Pasted image 20220213160406.png]]
	- Some obstetricians repair the uterus by first delivering the uterus through the abdominal incision and some repair it while it is still in the abdomen. 
		- The uterus is closed with one or two layers of suture (Figure E)![[Pasted image 20220213160430.png]]
	- The layers of the abdominal wall are sutured and then the skin closed with either suture or staples
