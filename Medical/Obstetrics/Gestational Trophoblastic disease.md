# Gestational Trophoblastic disease

- Types
	- Benign disorders 
		- Complete mole
		- Partial mole
	- Malignant disorder 
		- Invasive mole
		- Choriocarcinoma
		- Placental trophoblastic tumor
		- Endothelial trophoblastic tumor
- Etiology
	- Complete mole
		- Empty egg + 23,x Sperm --> Monospermic complete mole
			- MC type is 46,XX karyotype
	- Partial mole
		- 23,x egg + Dispermy --> Triploid Partial mole
			- MC karyotype is 69,XXX > 69,XXY
- p57kip2 immunostaining to differentiate between complete & partial mole
	- Paternally silenced & maternally expressed
	- positive staining in partial mole

## Benign disorders
- ![[Pasted image 20220608001845.png]]

- Excessive bHCG (More pronounced in complete than partial type)
	- Excessive Nausea & Vomiting
	- Hyper emesis
	- `bHCG ~ similar to beta subunit of LH` so Theca lutein cysts of ovary
	- Thyrotoxicosis due to stimulation of thyroid gland by acting as proxy for TSH
		- Short lasting
	- Early onset Preeclampsia --> due to extensive proliferation of villi
	- Pulmonary embolism / pulmonary edema due to metastasis(aka embolization of moles)
	- Chronic Bleeding PV --> anemia
