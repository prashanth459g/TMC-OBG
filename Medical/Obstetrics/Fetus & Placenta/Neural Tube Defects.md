# Neural Tube Defects
- Most common congenital anomalies due to failure of proper closure of neural tube covering mesoderm & ectoderm
- After 1 affected child there is a 5% increase chance of NTD in the next child & 10% chance if both Childs are affected
- Includes - *Anencephaly, Encephalocele, spina Bifida, iniencephaly*

### Etiology
- Multifactorial inheritance
- family h/o NTD
- Zinc & folate deficiency
- Alcohol
- Radiation exposure
- Insulin dependent DM
- Antifolate drugs --> Anti-convalescents, Aminopentein, isotretinoin
- Genetic syndromes -> T-13, T-15

### Prevention
- 0.4mg preconceptionally & continued till 12th week
- 5mg daily for the women with h/o previous child affected with NTD *or* On Antileptics

> Maternal serum alph fetoprotien estimation @16wk was used as screening test but Now replaced by USS
>  - Anencephaly is detected by T1 USS
>  - Open spina bifida defect - detected by 18-20 week

### Clinical Picture
- defect is obvious at birth/ through fetal sonography
- Spectrum ranges from *Occult* to *severe life threatening* problem
- Lumbosacral region is the most common site
- NTD's may be affected with other congenital anomalies & dysfunction of organ system
- May have lower body paralysis, bladder-bowel dysfunction, learning disabilities' & hydrocephalous d/t Arnold Chiari malformation type2

## Anencephaly 
is an important cause of fetal & infant mortality - **Incompatible with life**
- it is defined as absence of cranial vault.
	- due to failure of closure of anterior neuropore
- 1st anomaly detected by USS
	- diagnosed ~**12wks**
	- *Frog eyes* appearance 
- if pregnancy continues presents as face presentation

## Encephalocele
--> Bony defect with protrusion of brain tissue & meninges 
*Encephalocele + Polycystic kidneys ==> Meckel Gruber Syndrome* (AR)

## Spina bifida
- Defect in neural arch, expose to content of neural-canal
- Usually seen in lumbosacral region
- Constitutes 6% of all NTD's
- might be open or closed
	- In Closed -> lesion might be covered by skin 
	- when associated with protrusion of meninges, its called **Meningocele**
	- if Spinal cord is also prolapsed, it is called **MyeloMenigocele**
- USS
	- *lemon sign* -> due to scalloping of frontal bones
	- *Banana sign* -> abnormal posterior curvature of cerebellum

# Management
### Prenatal diagnosis
- Increases AFP levels b/w 14wk-16wk in Blood & Amniotic fluid
- Additional test in amniotic fluid - acetyl-choline esterase estimation
- USS detection is 100%
- Ix -> 
	- USS head, meningocele, abdomen
	- Chest, spine X-ray
### Treatment 
*Team Approach* -> Pediatrician, Neurologist, Neurosurgeon, Urologist, Ortho, Physiotherapist, Psychiatrist
- Surgery --> Closure of defect & VP shunt
	- Open lesions closed with in <24hrs
	- Closed lesions corrected with in <48hrs
- **Lorber's criteria** for Selective surgery
	- Surgery Not recommended if 
		- severe Paraplegia at/below L3, Kyphosis, Scoliosis, Gross hydrocephalous
		- Associated gross congenital anomalies
		- Intracerebral Birth injuries
		- Neonatal ventriculitis before closure of defect

### Prognosis
- Delayed intervention cause complications like infection, progressive hydrocephalus, worsening of neurological defect
- late complications include
	- Hydrocephalus
	- UTI
	- Enuresis
	- fecal incontinences, constipation
	- Intellectual deterioration
	- epilepsy
	- Shunt infection
	- Ocular problems
- 2% die during initial hospitalization, 15% die by 10 years
### Prevention 
Primary Prevention
- Preconceptional Folate supplementation
- food fortification
- Zinc, Vit-A Supplementation
- Dosage 
	- 0.4mg /day
	- 4mg/day in mother having previous NTD child
- Duration --> **2 Months before & till 3months after *Conception***
