# Fetal Growth Restriction
- Fetal growth restriction (FGR) refers to a condition in which a fetus is unable to achieve its genetically determined potential size.
	- This functional definition seeks to identify a population of fetuses at risk for modifiable but otherwise poor outcomes. 
	- This definition intentionally *excludes* fetuses that are small for gestational age (SGA) but are not pathologically small. 
	- **SGA is defined as growth at the 10th or less percentile for weight of all fetuses at that gestational age.** 
	- Not all fetuses that are SGA are pathologically growth restricted and, in fact, may be constitutionally small. Similarly, not all fetuses that have not met their genetic growth potential are in less than the 10th percentile for estimated fetal weight (EFW).

| Stage | Pathophysiological correlate                     | Criteria (any of) | Monitoring* | GA/mode of delivery |
| ----- | ------------------------------------------------ | ----------------- | ----------- | ------------------- |
| I     | Severe smallness or mild placental insufficiency | EFW <3rd centile, CPR < p5, UA PI >p95, MCA PI < p5, UtA PI >p95| Weekly | 37 weeks Labour Induction|
|II |Severe placental insufficiency| UA AEDV Reverse AoI | Biweekly | 34 weeks CS |
| III | Low-suspicion fetal acidosis | UA REDV DV-PI >p95 | 1 – 2 days | 30 weeks CS |
|IV | High-suspicion fetal acidosis | DV reverse a flow, cCTG <3 ms, FHR decelerations | 12 h | 26 weeks** CS |
All Doppler signs described above should be confirmed at least twice, ideally at least 12 h apart. 
\* Recommended intervals in the absence of severe preeclampsia. If FGR is accompanied by this complication, strict fetal monitoring is warranted regardless of the stage.
\** Lower GA threshold recommended according to current literature figures reporting at least 50% intact survival. Threshold could be tailored according to parents’ wishes or adjusted according to local statistics of intact survival.
