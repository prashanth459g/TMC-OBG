# Hyperemesis Gravidarum & Nausea and Vomiting of pregnancy
- Nausea and vomiting in pregnancy (NVP) affects up to 80% of pregnant women and is one of the most common indications for hospital admission among pregnant women. 
- It typically starts between the 4-7th weeks of pregnancy, peaks around 9th week, and resolves by the 20th week in 90% of women. Rule out other causes if first presentation is after 10 completed weeks of pregnancy.
- it can be **defined** as intractable vomiting associated with loss of more than 5% of pre pregnancy weight, dehydration, electrolyte disturbances, or need for hospital admission. 
- There is a high risk of recurrence in subsequent pregnancies. Consider diabetic ketoacidosis as an alternative diagnosis in a ketotic woman with diabetes.
- *Risk factors and associations*:
	- First pregnancy
	- Multiple pregnancy
	- History of severe nausea and vomiting in previous pregnancies, motion sickness, or nausea with oral contraceptive use
	- Gestational Trophoblastic disease (GTD), including molar pregnancy
	- History of migraines
	- History of first degree relative with NVP
	- Obesity
	- Stress
	- Being seropositive for Helicobacter pylori
- History 
	- to Quantify severity
	- To exclude other causes: abdominal pain, urinary symptoms, infection, drug history
	- inability to tolerate oral fluid, effecting the quality of life.
	- May be associated with ptyalism, olfactory & gustatory aversion. 
	- H/o hyperemesis in previous pregnancy's 
	- h/o motion sickness or migraine 
	- Family history 
	- Negative history to rule out other causes
		- Abdominal pain
		- Urinary infection/sepsis
- Examination
	- Includes basic observations, *weight*, abdominal examination, signs of dehydration, urine output, and other examination as guided by history.
	- Anxious appearance, sunken eyes, dry tongue, ketotic odor of breath, loss of skin elasticity, tachycardia, Hypotension
	- up to 5% weight loss may be present
	- Oliguria
	- Icterus in severe cases
	- abdominal/vaginal examination to confirm uterine ðŸ¤° 
- Investigations:
	- On admission all patients require:
		- Urine dipstick to quantify ketonuria
		- URE to exclude UTI if any positive findings on urine dip
		- CBC -> sepsis, hemoconcentration, anemia
		- S.E. to identify electrolyte imbalance
		- For diabetic patients, checking capillary blood glucose regularly is mandatory
		- periodically check TFTs, LFTs, blood group, magnesium, and amylase.
			- Suggested frequency at least every second attendance, or more frequently if abnormal. 
			- TFTs may be checked less frequently such as once in first trimester and once in second trimester unless any abnormality noted.
				- transient Thyrotoxicosis can be seen in case of raised beta HCG
	- In Refractory cases
		- S.E. including Ca<sup>+2</sup>, Po<sub>4</sub><sup>-2</sup> .
		- TFT, ABG
		- LFT and Amylase 
			- ~40% have â†‘ Transaminases, no clinical jaundice
			- Â± â†‘Amylase 
			- Rule out Acute pancreatitis 
	- USG --> Singleton / Multiple / GTD
		- not an emergency scan
- The condition spontaneously resolves in the vast majority of patients and complications are rare.
- **Complications**
	- Weight loss
	- Electrolyte imbalance
	- Abnormal LFTs
	- Abnormal TFTs
	- Central pontine myelinolysis (CPM)
	- Wernickeâ€™s encephalopathy
	- Other vitamin deficiencies (Â± megaloblastic anaemia), such as B12 or B6
	- Venous thromboembolism (VTE)
	- Adverse pregnancy outcomes including low birth weight, and increased risk of preterm delivery
	- Adverse effect on quality of life and mental health
	- Mechanical complications including Mallory-Weiss tears, retinal haemorrhage
### PUQE

- old scoring was "Rhode score"
Pregnancy-Unique Quantification of Emesis (PUQE)
Total score is sum of replies to each of the three questions. 
PUQE-24 score: Mild â‰¤ 6; Moderate = 7â€“12; Severe = 13â€“15. 

| Motherisk PUQE-24 scoring system                                                                      | 1          | 2              | 3         | 4         | 5             |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------- | -------------- | --------- | --------- | ------------- |
| In the last 24 hours, for how long have you felt nauseated or sick to your stomach?                   | Not at all | 1 hour or less | 2â€“3 hours | 4â€“6 hours | More than 6hr |
| In the last 24 hours have you vomited or thrown up?                                                   | I did not  | 1â€“2 times      | 3â€“4 times | 5â€“6 times | 7 or more     |
| In the last 24 hours how many times have you had retching or dry heaves without bringing anything up? | No time    | 1â€“2 times      | 3â€“4 times | 5â€“6 times | 7 or more     |


### Management 
![[Pasted image 20220702054314.png]]
- Inpatient management should be considered if there is at least one of the following:
	1. continued nausea and vomiting and inability to keep down oral antiemeticâ€™s
	2. continued nausea and vomiting associated with ketonuria and/or weight loss (greater than 5% of body weight), despite oral antiemeticâ€™s
	3. Confirmed or suspected comorbidity (such as urinary tract infection and inability to tolerate oral antibiotics).
	4. Weigh patient on admission, then twice weekly.
- **Intravenous (IV) infusions**
	- Insert non-ported cannula for IV access
	- The rate of rehydration depends on the severity of NVP but usually aggressive rehydration with 1 liter of 0.9% saline with 20mmol potassium chloride (KCl) over 2 hours is often appropriate
	- 0.9% saline with additional potassium chloride in each bag, guided by daily monitoring of electrolytes is the most appropriate IV hydration regimen as per RCOG guidance
	- If hypokalaemic, 20-40mmol of KCl in 0.9% saline (note maximum infusion rate 10mmol/hr of KCl)
	- Dextrose infusions are not appropriate 
		- unless the serum *sodium levels are normal* and *thiamine has been administered*
	- Avoid glucose as it can precipitate Wernickeâ€™s encephalopathy.
- **Antiemetics**
	- There are safety and efficacy data for first line antiemetics such as H1 receptor antagonists and they should be prescribed first when required. 
	- Combination of drugs from different classes should be used in women who do not respond to a single antiemetic
	- *Metoclopramide*
		- it should be used for short-term, maximum of 30mg/24hr, maximum of 5days
		- these dopamine antagonists have extra pyramidal symptoms
	- T. doxinate 10mg TDS for 5 days
		1. Doxylamine --> it is H1 antagonist 
		2. Pyridoxine --> has antiemetic property
	- Use all antiemetics regularly rather than PRN
	- The parenteral or rectal route may be necessary and more effective than the oral regimen for women with severe or persistent NVP

- When all other medical therapies have failed, enteral or parenteral treatment should be considered with a multidisciplinary approach. 
	- In refractory cases artificial nutritional support should be considered. Enteral (nasogastric or nasojejunal) or parenteral feeding can be considered. 
	- %%The MUST screening tool may be useful. %%Enteral feeding is contraindicated in women with acute vomiting due to the risk of aspiration ensure correct procedure
- **Thiamine**
	- Should be given to all women attending with prolonged vomiting, to prevent vitamin deficiency and Wernickeâ€™s encephalopathy.
	- Thiamine 50mg oral once daily should be given for10 day 
- **Iron**
	- Consider avoiding iron-containing preparations if these exacerbate symptoms
- Anti-GERD
	- Proton pump inhibitors (e.g. omeprazole) or H2 receptor antagonists may be used for women developing gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GERD). Both are considered to be safe in pregnancy.
- **Venous Thromboembolism (VTE)**
	- Perform VTE risk assessment 
- *Patient education*
	- Reassurance
	- Rest
	- Dietary and lifestyle advice
	- Patient information leaflet e.g. -->
		- https://www.rcog.org.uk/globalassets/documents/patients/patientinformation-leaflets/pregnancy/pi-pregnancy-sickness.pdf
		- https://www.pregnancysicknesssupport.org.uk/resources/printableleaflets/
