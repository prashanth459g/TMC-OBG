# Lactation
- It can be divided into 5 stages
	- **Mammogenesis** : Development of breast to functional  state
		- Breast size and weight increases - this increase volume is due to development of secretory tissue
		- Estrogen responsible for *Ductal* Development
		- Progesterone responsible for *Alveolar* Development
	- **Lactogenesis** : Synthesis and Secretion of milk from breast alveoli, it has 3 stages
		- Stage 1 / Secretory *initiation*: 
			- Mammary glands differentiate
			- ==Colostrum== is produced :- increase in lactose, total proteins, immunoglobulins. Decrease in sodium and chloride
			- High level of Estrogen & Progesterone can inhibit milk secretion
		- Stage 2 / Secretory *Activation*: it occurs during 2-3 days of postpartum
			- Blood flow to breast increases
			- Switch from endocrine to autocrine control
			- This is triggered by ↓ progesterone levels and ↑ levels of Prolactin, cortisol, insulin
		- Stage 3 / *Galactopoiesis* : begins 4-6days of postpartum helps in maintaining milk production till weaning
	- **Galactokinesis** : Ejection of milk outside the breast, function of oxytocin
	- **Galactopoiesis**/Lactation : maintenance of lactation
		- How is the regulation of milk synthesis done now? 
		- Actual volume of milk secreted is adjusted according to the requirement of the baby. there is a feedback inhibitor of lactation.
		- Rate of the milk synthesis is related to the degree of breast emptiness or fullness. 
		- Increased suckling of the hungry infant leads to increased Emptying of the breast and again there will be increased milk volume. If the breast remains full for longer period of time, i.e increased inter-feeding intervals. The milk production will also decrease
		- factors that affect the milk production which includes stress and fatigue. this is due to increased dopamine, increase norepinephrine or even both and that inhibits the prolactin synthesis 
			- So if a mother is more anxious about feeding her baby, the lesser the amount of milk and lesser the production of milk. 
			- So relaxation. Is very essential for a successful lactation.
	- **Involution** : Regression and atrophy post lactation
		- involution occurs 40 days after the last breastfeeding. secretion decreases due to building up of the inhibiting peptides and the lack of stimulatory hormones. 



- what are the advice that you would give to a lactating mother? 
	- You must ensure good health. early and sufficient treatment of illnesses. 
	- A proper balance between rest and exercise. 
	- You must tell her not to worry. - address her concern scientifically 
	- Take care of the nipples and the breast during pregnancy 
	- Postnatally, you must advise frequent breastfeeding and avoid formula feeds. 
	- Avoid breast engorgement. 
	- Give her plenty of fluids and adequate nutrition and good support from the family is very important for a successful lactation. 

## Hormones of lactation - Prolactin and Oxytocin
- Sound of baby cry -> removes Prolactin inhibitory factors(dopamine) -> ↑ prolactin levels -> Milk synthesis 
- Suckling -> signals to hypothalamus -> release of stored oxytocin from posterior pituitary -> Milk ejection
- ![[Pasted image 20230904023843.png]]
- **Oxytocin**
	- Responsible for ==letdown reflex/ milk ejection reflex==
	- synthesized in hypothalamus - more about oxytocin ?here
	- Acts on Myoepithelial cells of lactiferous ducts -> contraction of cells that line the duct -> expulsion of milk in to ducts and sub<u>areolar</u> sinuses -> empty through nipple pore
### *Pro*lactin 
- Polypeptide from anterior pituitary
- Synthesized by lactotrophic cells
- Structurally similar to GH and hPL(human placental lactogen)
- Acts on prolactin receptors in epithelial cells
- stimulates secretion of milk
- under inhibitory control of hypothalamus through dopamine -> inhibition is removed by sound of baby's cry
## LATCH score
- The LATCH score is a breastfeeding assessment tool that assigns a numerical score to five key components of breastfeeding. The letters in the acronym LATCH stand for:
	- L: How well the infant *latches* onto the breast
	- A: The amount of *audible swallowing*
	- T: *Types of nipple* in mother
	- C: The mother's level of *comfort*
	- H: The amount of support the mother has been given to *hold* her
- The total score ranges from 0 to 10. A score of 0–3 is considered poor, 4–7 is moderate, and 8–10 is good. A score of 8 or higher at 48 hours indicates a high chance of exclusive breastfeeding for the next 6 months. A score of less than 8 indicates that the mother is having difficulty feeding.
- The LATCH score is a simple and cost-effective tool that can be used to assess and monitor breastfeeding. It can be especially useful in low-resource settings.
