# Mullerian anomalies
- Congenital malformations of the female genital tract are defined as deviations from normal anatomy resulting from embryological maldevelopment of the Müllerian or paramesonephric ducts. 
- They represent a rather common benign condition with a prevalence of 4–7%
## System's of classification 
- Why classify
	- classification systems play a crucial role enabling the better understanding of the disease processes by their users since pathogenesis is usually taken into account for their development, helping the diagnostic work-up of patients and the therapeutic decision-making process as well
	- It is important to note that the selection of the basic characteristic and how it is used for the patients’ categorization are crucial for patients’ grouping
	- Furthermore they are the key points for the differences observed between the different classification systems. It is also obvious that the acceptance of a system is mainly correlated to its effectiveness to fulfill the clinicians’ needs in understanding, diagnosing and treating patient

### ASRM Müllerian Anomalies Classification (MAC2021)
- Old classification
	- 7 types ![[Pasted image 20230804011357.png]]
- PDF
	- ![[MAC2021_-_print.pdf]]
- MAC2021 classifies müllerian anomalies into 9 categories based on similar elements in appearance, presentation, and treatment. As müllerian anomalies represent a continuum of development and many have combined elements, some anomalies may appear in more than one category:
	- Müllerian agenesis
		- Symptoms
			- Pubertal female with primary amenorrhea
			- Primary amenorrhea with cyclic pelvic 
				- Pain suggests presence of Rudimentary uterine horn(s) with Functional endometrium
			- Primary amenorrhea with chronic Pelvic pain from retrograde Menstruation
		- Examination
			- Vaginal canal shortened (dimple) or several centimeters long
			- No palpable uterus or cervix on vaginal or rectal exam
			- Rudimentary uterine horn(s) may be present on imaging
		- Differentials
			- Androgen insensitivity syndrome
			- Distal vaginal agenesis
			- Transverse vaginal septum
			- Imperforate hymen
			- Cervical agenesis
	- Cervical agenesis
		- Symptoms
			- Pubertal age female
			- Primary amenorrhea
			- Cyclic pelvic pain from menstrual blood distending uterus and early retrograde menstruation occurs
			- Pelvic pain typically severe soon after menstrual bleeding first occurs, may be episodic since young adolescents often have irregular menses
		- Examination
			- Tender low abdomen 
			- Vaginal canal shortened or typical length 
			- No visible cervix 
		- Differentials
			- Transverse vaginal septum
			- Distal vaginal agenesis
			- imperforate hymen 
			- MRKH with functional endometrium within uterine remnants
			- Other anomalies with obstruction
	- Unicornuate uterus
		- Symptoms
			- Normal menstruation from patent unicornuate uterus
			- Lateralized cyclic pelvic pain from  obstructed uterine remnant with functional endometrium on contralateral side
			- Pregnancy concerns:
				- Unicornuate uterus
				- Preterm labor 
				- Malpresentation 
				- Pregnancy loss 
			- Uterine remnant 
		- Examination
			- Normal vagina and cervix
			-  Unicornuate uterus deviated towards one side of pelvis Contralateral uterine remnant  Uterine remnant with functional endometrium could present as an adnexal mass
			- Contralateral ovary maybe in an abnormal location
		- Differentials
			- Normal uterus deviated laterally due to pelvic pathology
			- Uterus didelphys with obstruct‘ing longitudinal vaginal septum (OHVIRA)
			- Complete septate uterus with obstructed longitudinal vaginal septum 
			- Bicornuate uterus with two cervices and obstructing longitudinal vaginal septum
			- Robert’s uterus :
	- Uterus didelphys
		- Uterus didelphys is a congenital disorder of the female genital system that occurs when the embryonic millerian ducts fail to fuse. It ==manifests as two separate uterine bodies, two separate cervices, and may include a longitudinal vaginal septum that divides the vaginal canal into two cavities.==
		- Symptoms
			- May be asymptomatic, does not disrupt menstrual flow 
			- Often identified by longitudinal vaginal septum or pregnancy concerns
			- Longitudinal vaginal septum:
				- Dyspareunia 
				- Menstrual leakage with tampon use 
				- Lateralized cyclic pelvic pain from obstructed longitudinal vaginal septum causing hematometrocolpos 
				- Abnormal bleeding or persistent vaginal discharge from obstructed longitudinal vaginal septum with microperforation
			- Pregnancy concerns:
				- Preterm labor 
				- Malpresentation 
				- Pregnancy loss 
		- Examination
			- .Widely splayed uteri 
			- Normal vagina with two cervices 
			- Longitudinal vaginal septum:
				- Variable length
				- May not be midline
			- Vaginal openings may be unequal in size 
			- Duplicate cervices
				- May be asymmetric in appearance and location
			- Obstructed longitudinal vaginal septum with ipsilateral pelvic mass from hematometrocolpos (see longitudinal vaginal septum)
			- Evaluate for renal anomalies. Ipsilateral renal agenesis or anomaly associated with obstructed longitudinal| vaginal septum 
		- Differentials
			- Bicornuate uterus 
			- Normal uterus with duplicated cervix 
			- Complete septate uterus with or without obstructed longitudinal vaginal septum 
			- Unicornuate uterus with longitudinal vaginal septum 
			- Unicornuate uterus with nonfunctional or functional millerian remnant 
	- Bicornuate uterus
		- bicornuate uterus is defined as having an external fundal indentation depth > 10 mm
		- [[Mullerian anomalies#^18e112]] ESHRE
			- ESHRE/ESGE consensus distinguishes three subclasses of bicorporeal uterus: partial bicorporeal, complete bicorporeal and bicorporeal-septate uterus. Whereas all three subclasses should meet the criterion of external fundal indentation > 50% of the uterine wall thickness, the bicorporeal-septate subclass is specifically defined as midline fundal indentation > 150% of the uterine wall thickness. 
			- In MAC2021, the proposed criterion for both simple bicornuate and combined bicornuate-septate uterus is external indentation depth (serosal indentation) > 10 mm, yet no measurable cut-off is proposed to distinguish between the two. This augments subjectiveness and decreases diagnostic reproducibility
			- ![[Pasted image 20230804022945.png]]
	- Septate uterus
		- is defined as having an internal indentation depth > 10 mm ==+== with an internal indentation angle < 90°.
		- _Normal_ vs _arcuate uterus_
			- The MAC2021 defines as normal a uterus ‘having no indentation’ (i.e. with complete absence of internal fundal uterine indentation). This definition is not supported by any reference and reflects an unrealistic view.
			- It is reasonable that MAC2021 classified arcuate uterus together with normal uterus to indicate the insignificant clinical relevance of arcuate uterus. However, according to MAC2021, a normal/arcuate uterus has an internal indentation depth ≤ 10 mm and an internal indentation angle > 90°.
		- As such, cases with internal indentation depth > 10 mm and indentation angle ≥ 90° (which we estimate comprises a significant proportion of septate uteri) and cases with internal indentation depth ≤ 10 mm and indentation angle < 90° would continue to fall within the gray zone according to the MAC2021 definition and would remain unclassifiable
		- Imaging
			- ![[Pasted image 20230804014113.png]]
		- 
	- Longitudinal vaginal septum
		- Symptoms
			- Without obstruction:
				- Asymptomatic 
				- Difficulty with tampon use 
				- Menstrual leakage with tampon use 
				- Dyspareunia 
				- Laceration with intercourse 
			- With obstruction
				- Lateralized pelvic pain from hematometrocolpos 
				- Cyclic or chronic pelvic pain
				- Abnormal uterine bleeding from microperforate vaginal obstruction
				- Abnormal vaginal discharge from microperforate vaginal obstruction 
		- Examination
			- Septum involving portion of or entire length of vagina 
			- Single, septate or duplicated cervix
			- Obstructed longitudinal vaginal septum with ipsilateral pelvic mass from hematometrocolpos 
			- Microperforate opening vaginal side wall
		- Differentials
			- Incomplete transverse vaginal septum
			- Vaginismus
			- Hymenal anomaly
			- Vaginal adhesions
	- Transverse vaginal septum
		- Symptoms
			- Pubertal age female
			- Complete septum:
				- Primary amenorrhea
				- Cyclic or intermittent pelvic pain due to hematometrocolpos
			- Partial septum
				- May be asymptomatic, does not disrupt menstrual flow
				- Difficulty with tampon use
				- Dyspareunia
				- Abnormal vaginal discharge
				- Intermittent pain from hematocolpos (microperforation)
		- Examination
			- Normal hymen and introitus 
			- Shortened vagina on exam, no cervix visualized -> Low, middle or high vaginal transverse septum 
			- Pelvic mass from hematocolpos
			- Partial vaginal septum opening may range from pinpoint to tight vaginal band
		- Differentials
			- Imperforate hymen
			- Distal vaginal atresia
			- Miillerian agenesis
			- Cervical agenesis or atresia
			- Vaginal malignancy
	- Complex Anomalies 
		- Complex Mullerian anomalies are those that are not well defined in other categories, or reflect unusual combinations of vaginal/cervical/uterine anomalies. They are typically similar to some more well known anomalies but with an unusual twist. 
		- As Mullerian anomalies reflect a continuum of development there are undoubtable more to be described. Diagnosis should involve an interaction between experienced radiologists and the clinical team and may involve additional imaging or even an exam under anesthesia to plan appropriate treatment. Surgery should only be performed by experienced reproductive surgeons.
- Didelphys **vs** Bicornuate **vs** septate
	- Uterus didelphys is a congenital disorder of the female genital system that occurs when the embryonic millerian ducts fail to fuse. It ==manifests as two separate uterine bodies, two separate cervices, and may include a longitudinal vaginal septum that divides the vaginal canal into two cavities.==
		- ![[Pasted image 20230811015446.png]]
	- Bicornuate uterus is a congenital disorder of the female genital system that occurs when the upper portion of the Mullerian ducts fail to fuse, but the distal portion that develops into the lower uterine segment, cervix and upper vagina fuses normally. It ==manifests as two partially separate uterine bodies, with external fundal indentation of > 1.0 cm, with some degree of uniﬁcation at the inferior aspect.== Typically manifests with single cervix and vagina.
		- ![[Pasted image 20230811014900.png]],![[Pasted image 20230811015002.png]]
	- Septate uterus is a congenital disorder of the female genital system that manifests as a *single uterine body externally*, single cervix, and vagina. However, the cavity of the uterus is divided by an invagination of ﬁbrous and muscle arising in the fundal region and extending to the internal cervical 05 or further. The conﬁguration is attributed to failure of uterine septum resorption during embryo genesis. The **septum is deﬁned as having a depth of > 1.0 cm, with an angle of leading edge of the septum of <90°**.
		- ![[Pasted image 20230811015335.png]]
- No measurable criteria to distinguish between bicornuate and combined bicornuate-septate uterus
### ESHRE 
- ![[Mullerian anomalies#^18e112]]
- 0 is normal, 6 is unclassified
- U1/Dysmorphic
	- It is defined as any uterus having normal uterine outline but with an abnormal shape of the uterine cavity excluding septa
	- U1a is T Shaped - having normal correlation 2/3 uterine corpus and 1/3 cervix, and characterized by a narrow uterine cavity due to thickened lateral walls (giving to it the characteristic T shape)
	- U1b/infantilis - having an inverse correlation 1/3 uterine body and 2/3 cervix, and characterized also by a narrow uterine cavity but without lateral wall thickening.
	- U1c or others, including all minor deformities of the uterine cavity and incorporating also those with an inner indentation at the fundal midline level of <50 % of the uterine wall thickness. This aims to facilitate clinical research for patients with minor deformities and to clearly differentiate them from patients with septate uterus
- U2 or septate uterus 
	- It is defined as any uterus with normal outline and an internal indentation at the fundal midline exceeding 50 % of the uterine wall thickness. 
	- Septate uterus is an absorption embryological defect of the midline septum; fusion is normal.  
	- U2a or partial septate uterus characterized by the existence of a septum dividing partly the uterine cavity above the level of the internal cervical os and, 
	- U2b or complete septate uterus characterized by the existence of a septum fully dividing the uterine cavity up to the level of the internal cervical os. Patients with complete septate uterus (Class U2b) could have or not cervical (e.g. bicervical septate uterus) and/or vaginal defects.
- U3 or bicorporeal uterus 
	- It is defined as any uterus with an external indentation at the fundal midline exceeding 50 % of the uterine wall thickness; it is an embryological fusion defect. 
	- divided into three subclasses according to the degree of the uterine corpus deformity: 
		- U3a or partial bicorporeal uterus , characterized by an external fundal indentation partly dividing the uterine corpus above the level of the cervix.
		- U3b or complete bicorporeal uterus , characterized by an external fundal indentation completely dividing the uterine corpus up to the level of the cervix. Patients with complete bicorporeal uterus could, also, have co- existent cervical (e.g. double cervix/AFS didelphys uterus) and/or vaginal defects (e.g. obstructing or not vaginal septum). 
		- U3c or bicorporeal septate uterus characterized by a width of the midline fundal indentation exceeding 150 % the uterine wall thickness due to the presence of an absorption defect in addition to the main fusion defect. These patients could be partially treated by hysteroscopic cross section of the septate element of the defect.
- U4 or hemi-uterus 
	- It is defined as the unilateral uterine development; the contralateral part could be either incompletely formed or absent; it is a formation defect. 
	- U4 is further divided into two subclasses depending on the presence or not of a functional rudimentary cavity since this is the only clinically important factor for complications such as hemato-cavity or ectopic pregnancy
		- U4a or hemi-uterus with a rudimentary (functional) cavity characterized by the presence of a communicating or noncommunicating functional contralateral horn. 
		- U4b or hemi-uterus without rudimentary (functional) cavity characterized either by the presence of non-functional contralateral uterine horn or by full aplasia of the contralateral part. 
- U5 or aplastic uterus 
	- It is defined as the absence of any fully or unilaterally developed uterine cavity. 
	- It is a formation defect incorporating all cases of uterine aplasia. Patients with aplastic uterus could have co-existent defects (e.g. vaginal aplasia/MayerRokitansky- Kuster-Hauser syndrome).
	- further divided into two sub-classes depending on the presence or not of a functional cavity in an existent rudimentary horn since this is the only clinically important factor for the presence of health related problems such as cyclic pain and hemato-cavity:
		- U5a or aplastic uterus with rudimentary (functional) cavity characterized by the presence of bi- or unilateral functional horn, 
		- U5b or aplastic uterus without rudimentary (functional) cavity characterized either by the presence of uterine remnants or by full uterine aplasia. 



## Etiology
- The direct cause of genital malformations is unknown despite the many different theories and hypotheses in this area
- environmental causes can only explain some cases. 
	- Apart from the DES syndrome (Diethylstilbestrol syndrome), other teratogenic drugs, malnutrition, metabolic alterations, viral infections and placental anomalies have been implied.
	- A number of chemicals released in the environment can bind to the ERs and exhibit estrogenic activity similar to 17β-estradiol. Epidemiological studies have shown that those chemicals, known as environmental endocrine disruptors or xenoestrogens, had an adverse impact on the woman’s health and fertility over the past few decades
- association between didelphys uterus and trisomies 13–15 has been described
- the anomaly can be a part of a more general malformative syndrome, such as the 
	- MURCS association (Müllerian duct, renal and cervicothoracic somite aplasia/dysplasia association), 
		- it is speculated that the combination of müllerian duct, renal and skeletal anomalies seen in the MURCS association is due to a teratogenic event late in the **fourth week of fetal life**, when the cervicothoracic somite mesoderm and pronephric duct are in close proximity thus, due to a ==damage of the para-axil mesoderm==
	- the uterus-hand-foot syndrome with characteristic dermatoglyphics 
	- the Klippel-Feil anomaly (fused cervical vertebrae), 
	- the Winter syndrome (middle ear anomalies)
	- Fraser, Meckel, Rudiger and Edwards and Gale’s syndromes speculated .

- Clinical implication
	- A thorough clinical investigation should be offered for every woman diagnosed with a genital tract defect, as it is well known that such malformations are often accompanied by renal, skeletal and cardiovascular abnormalities. In that case, genetic analysis is recommended for the woman, her siblings and her female offsprings only if the coexistent anomalies suggest the presence of a syndrome. Finally, a thorough investigation of the anatomy of the reproductive tract is recommended for every woman when prenatal exposure to endocrine disruptors is suspected, especially if there is a history of infertility or recurrent miscarriage
## Pathogenesis
- these are the result of four major developmental defects during fetal life: 
	1. ==failure of one or both Müllerian ducts to form== results in hemi-uterus without rudimentary cavity (class U4b according to the new ESHRE/ESGE classifi cation system) or aplastic uterus (class U5) respectively. Aplastic uterus is the most severe Müllerian defect. Cervical and vaginal aplasia commonly co-exist and this is known as Mayer-Rokitansky-KusterHauser (MRKH) syndrome or Müllerian aplasia (MA)
	2. ==failure of the ducts to canalize== results in hemi-uterus with rudimentary cavity (class U4a); 
	3. failure of or abnormal ==fusion== of the ducts results in bicorporeal uterus (class U3);
	4. failure of ==re-absorption== of the midline uterine septum
- The role of the Wolffian or mesonephric ducts is also quite important in the pathogenesis of genital tract anomalies. Apart from their crucial role in renal development, they also act as inducer of Müllerian duct development.
- Some rare anomalies of the vagina result from failure of the urogenital sinus to contribute to the caudal part of the vagina (vaginal atresia) or from failure of the urogenital sinus derivatives and Müllerian duct derivatives to meet and canalize
- It is important to note that although some of anomalies are the result of an embryological defect in only one stage of embryological development, others are the result of a combined defect in more than one embryological stages and, making the issue more complex, of different embryological defects in the different parts of the female genital system
## Implantation
- #half_read😴 
## Clinical implication
- Cyclic Pelvic Pain
	- Then their main presenting symptom is amenorrhea and cyclical abdominal pain, although in cases of fusion defects of the genital tract (e.g. complete bicorporeal uterus with double cervix and longitudinal obstructing vaginal septum – U3b/C2/V2), menstruation from the unilateral horn of the uterus may still occur. Normal secondary sexual characteristics are present
	- Patients who have any obstruction to menstrual fl ow, are at increased risk for endometriosis
- Ectopic 🤰 
	- Pregnancies in the rudimentary horn have been described, they occur when migration of a sperm takes place through the abdominal cavity and show a higher incidence for abortion or rupture of the horn. It has been reported that the incidence of ectopic pregnancy in the non-communicating horn is as high as 22 %
- Renal Abnormalities Occurring with Female Genital Malformations 
	- The incidence of renal anomalies in this group of patients is approximately 30 %, with unilateral kidney absence being the most common abnormality, while the incidence of unilateral kidney absence in the normal population is around 1 in 1,000
	- so always workup 
- Psychological Aspects
	- Mullerian aplasia has the goal of eliminating the impact of the knowledge that these individuals have no vagina or even uterus and aims to the reduction of the emotional trauma of these adolescents. There are certainly two parties involved in this issue: the patient itself, which is usually a young adolescent and the parents.
### Fertility
- #half_read😴 

### 🤰 Outcomes
- Looking at the different classes of uterine anomalies, the so-called resorption or canalization defects, namely arcuate and septate uteri, have the highest prevalence rate (22.0 %) in high- risk patients with miscarriage and infertility, whereas unification defects have lower prevalence rates in the same patient population (bicornuate 4.7 %; unicornuate 3.1 %; Didelphys 2.1 %)
- Hemi Uterus/unicornuate
	- The challenge faced by patients with unicornuate uterus has long been thought to be pregnancy maintenance rather than impaired fertility, patients have higher frequencies of spontaneous abortions in the fi rst and second trimester, preterm labor, and abnormal fetal presentations. assisted reproductive technology data, however, suggest that clinical pregnancy rates are reduced by 33 % in patients with unicornuate uterus, which contradicts the former statement 
	- rudimentary - Ectopic
	- Three main factors have been suggested as possible causes of absolute lowest pregnancy
		- diminished muscle mass: the unicornuate uterus walls are thinner than normal, myometrium diminishes in thickness as gestational age advances, causing inconsistencies over different aspects of the uterus . This reduced myometrial muscle thickness is supposed to play a role in both second-trimester abortion and premature delivery, which accounts for up to 25 % of these patients; 
		- abnormal uterine blood flow: disturbance in the uterine blood flow caused by an absent or abnormal uterine or ovarian artery, which could explain growth restriction or spontaneous abortion. Poor vascularization could lead to impaired fetal nutrition, reduced fetal size and higher incidence of first-trimester abortion for compromised utero-placental blood flow; 
		- cervical incompetence: unlikely that it plays a key role given that the great majority of pregnancy losses in unicornuate uteri occur during the first trimester.
- Bicorporeal (AFS Bicornuate & Didelphys)
	- rare 
	- usually good outcome
	- Fertility seems not to be impaired
	- The cumulative pregnancy rates are 67 and 95 % in patients without surgical repair and 63 and 88 % in the surgery-treated group. The probability of giving birth to a live- born infant is as follows: with no corrective surgery 30, 58 and 79 % for the first, second and third pregnancy, respectively; after corrective surgery 71 and 86 % for the first and second pregnancy, respectively
- Septate uterus
	- A septate uterus has generally been associated with the poorest reproductive performance, with fetal survival rates between 6 and 28 % and abortion rates up to 80 %

## Treatment
- Vaginal Aplasia
	- ![[Pasted image 20230808040855.png]]
	- Frank Dilators
		- ![[Pasted image 20230808040145.png]]
		- The concept of vaginal dilation is based on the fact that the space between urethra and rectum is lined by supple connective tissue, leaving therefore a potential space for the vagina to be created or enlarged through application of pressure. Vaginal dilation is most commonly performed using personal, graduated, plastic dilators that come in three different sizes, ranging between 10 and 30 mm in diameter. 
		- Usually, a water based lubricant is used to facilitate the process. Initial pressure aims at enlarging the vaginal dimple away from the urethra, so as to avoid injuring it. Gradually, as the vagina lengthens, pressure is applied in an upward and slightly posterior direction, following the axis of the vagina. As the vagina grows in length, the second size dilator is used and finally the third, so as to simultaneously increase vaginal girth.
		- The appropriate time to commence vaginal dilation should be individualised. In most patients this will correspond with late adolescence to early adulthood. Professional psychological counselling will help identify the best time for initiating vaginal dilation, depending on time availability, motivation or the presence of a partner. Following completion of vaginal dilation, maintenance dilation is likely to be required, unless the patient is able to engage in regular sexual activity and this should be a factor to take into consideration when deciding whether to start vaginal dilation or not.
		- The available literature suggests an anatomical success rate between 40 and 90 %
