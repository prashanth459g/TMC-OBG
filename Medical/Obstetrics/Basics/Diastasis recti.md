# Diastasis recti
- Diastasis recti, or rectus abdominis diastasis, is defined as a gap of about 2.7 cm or greater between the two sides of the rectus abdominis muscle. 
	- The distance between the right and left rectus abdominis muscles is created by the stretching of the Linea Alba, a connective collagen sheath created by the aponeurosis insertions of the transverse abdominis, internal oblique, and external oblique.
	- This condition has no associated morbidity or mortality. 
	- Physical therapy is often required to repair this separation and surgery is an option for more severe cases. Standard exercise rarely results in complete healing of the separated muscles.
- Diastasis of the rectus abdominis muscle most frequently occurs in newborns and pregnant women; however, it may occur in any adult woman or man. 
	- In the newborn, the rectus abdominis is not fully developed and may not be sealed together at midline. Diastasis recti is more common in premature newborns. 
- In pregnant or postpartum women, the condition is caused by the stretching of the rectus abdominis by the growing uterus. 
	- It is more common in multiparous women (women who have had multiple pregnancies) owing to repeated episodes of stretching. When the defect occurs during pregnancy, the uterus can sometimes be seen bulging through the abdominal wall beneath the skin. 
	- Non-pregnant women are more susceptible to develop diastasis recti when over the age of 35 or with high birth weight of child, multiple birth pregnancy, or multiple pregnancies. 
	- Additional causes can be attributed to excessive abdominal exercises after the first trimester of pregnancy.[
