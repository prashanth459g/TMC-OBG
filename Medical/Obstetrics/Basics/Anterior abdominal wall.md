1. **Skin**
	- Langer's lines ![[Pasted image 20220511215104.png]]
	- Langer lines describe the orientation of dermal fibers within the skin.
	- they are arranged transversely .
	- clinical significance
		- vertical skin incisions sustain greater lateral tension and thus develop wider scars.
		- in contrast, low transverse incisions such as the Pfannensteil , follow langer's lines and lead to Superior cosmetic results.

2. **Subcutaneous layer and fascia**
	- the subcutaneous layer has two fascia
		![[Pasted image 20220213160631.png]]
		**1. Camper fascia**
			- superficial fatty layer
			- continues on to the peritoneum to provide fatty substance to the mons pubis and labia majora and then to blend with the fat of the ischio-anal fossa.
		**2. Scarpa fascia**
			- deep membranous layer
			- continues inferiorly onto the perineum as the *colle’s fascia*.
---
3. **Muscles** ![[Pasted image 20220511220030.png]]
	- In the midline – rectus abdominis & Pyramidalis muscles.
	- external oblique, internal oblique, transversus abdominis muscle.
		- the fibrous aponeuroses of these three muscles forms the primary fascia of The anterior abdominal wall – *linea alba* in The midline
			- normal measure of linea alba below Umbilicus – 1-1.5 cm in wideness (not length)
			- abnormally wide separation may reflect [[Diastasis recti]] or hernia.

- *External oblique muscle*
	- origin- arises as 8 fleshy strips from the outer surfaces of lower 8 ribs. ( the middle of the shaft).
	- The fibers run Downwards ,forwards and medially and Insertion in to -->
		1. the posterior-most fibers pass vertically downward to be inserted into the outer lip of the anterior two-third of the iliac crest. The posterior border is thus free.
		2. the remaining fibers insert into the Linea alba in the midline.
	- Nerve supply- anterior rami of lower 6 Thoracic spinal nerves.
![[Pasted image 20220511222009.png]]
--- 
- *Internal oblique muscle*
	- smaller and thinner than external oblique.
	- lies deep to external oblique and its fibers are at right angles to the external oblique
	- origin -->
		1. Lateral two thirds of the upper surface of the inguinal ligament.
		2. anterior two-thirds of the iliac crest.
		3. thoracolumbar fascia.
	- insertion -->
		1. most of the fibers run upward, forward and medially to insert into to the 7th, 8th and 9th costal cartilage and linea alba.
		2. posterior-most fibers ascend vertically upward and inserted by fleshy fibers into lower border of lower 3rd or 4th ribs and their costal margins.
		3. the fleshy fibers arise from inguinal Ligament arch over the inguinal canal and Its contents and then descend to be Inserted on to the pubic tubercle and Pecten pubis.
	- These fibers fuse with the corresponding tendinous fibers of the transversus abdominis muscle to form conjoint tendon.
	- nerve supply- anterior primary rami t7-t12 and also by ilio-inguinal and iliohypogastric nerves.

- *Transverses abdominis muscle*
	- innermost.
	- direction of fibers is transverse.
	- origin –> inguinal ligament, iliac crest , thoracolumbar fascia and inner surface of lower 6 ribs.
	- insertion –> inguinal fibers join conjoint tendon to get inserted into the pubic crest and pecten pubis.
	- nerve supply – t7 to t12 and also by ilio-inguinal and iliohypogastric. 
![[Pasted image 20220511222033.png]]

- **Rectus sheath** --> is aponeurotic sheath enclosing the rectus abdominis muscle (and pyramidalis muscle if Present) from either side of linea alba.
	- formation of rectus sheath & its contents of rectus sheath --> ![[Pasted image 20220511222402.png]]
	- two muscles - rectus abdominis and Pyramidalis
	- two arteries - superior epigastric and Inferior epigastric.
	- two veins - superior epigastric and inferior epigastric.
	- six nerves - terminal part of lower 6 thoracic nerves , including lower 5 Intercostal nerves and subcostal nerves.

- *Arcuate line* 
	- the arcuate line is an area of demarcation visible from the peritoneal surface of the abdominal wall, residing ==one-third== the distance between the umbilicus and the pubis.
	- Above this line
		the aponeuroses invest the rectus abdominis muscle on dorsal and ventral surfaces.
	- below this line
		- all aponeuroses lie ventral aka superficial to the rectus abdominis muscle.
	- midline vertical incision – upper third clearly shows this demarcation.

## Blood supply
- **skin, subcutaneous tissue and mons pubis** - 
	superficial epigastric 
	superficial circumflex iliac
	superficial external pudendal arteries 
	- They arise from the femoral artery just below the inguinal ligament.
		- ![[Pasted image 20230513055744.png]]
	- *Surgical significance* - of the three the commonly encountered vessel is the superficial epigastric because of its diagonal course from the origin towards umbilicus.
- **muscles and fascia supplied by** - deep epigastric vessels that arise from external iliac.
- near the umbilicus there is anastomosis between superior epigastric vessels and inferior epigastric vessels.
	- *surgical significance*- when a maylard incision is made , the inferior epigastric vessels may get lacerated during muscle transection , as the inferior epigastric vessel run through the lateral aspect of the rectus bellies.![[Pasted image 20220511224037.png]] ![[Pasted image 20220511224056.png]] 
	- these vessels may even rupture following abdominal trauma resulting in rectus sheath hematoma.
		- inferior epigastric vessels initially course lateral to, then posterior to the rectus abdominis muscles, which they supply. Above the arcuate line, these vessels course ventral to the posterior rectus sheath and lie between this sheath and the posterior surface of the rectus muscles
		- The external iliac artery provides the main blood supply to the legs. It passes down along the brim of the pelvis and gives off two large branches - the "inferior epigastric artery" and a "deep circumflex artery." These vessels supply blood to the muscles and skin in the lower abdominal wall. The external iliac artery passes beneath the inguinal ligament in the lower part of the abdomen and becomes the femoral artery.

## Nerve supply
- intercostal nerves- t7- t11.
- Subcostal nerve- t12
- iliohypogastric and ilioinguinal nerves- L1

1. Of these, the intercostal and subcostal nerves are anterior rami of the thoracic spinal nerves. Run along the lateral and then anterior abdominal wall ==between the transverses abdominis and internal oblique planes== ➡️ This space, termed as `transverses abdominis plane`.
	- *Clinical significance -> this space can be used for post cs analgesia blockade.*
	- ![[Pasted image 20220511225018.png]]
	- Near the rectus abdominis lateral borders, anterior branches of the intercostal and subcostal nerves pierce the posterior sheath, rectus muscle, and then anterior sheath to reach the skin. Thus, these nerve branches may be severed during a Pfannenstiel incision creation during the step in which the overlying anterior rectus sheath is separated from the rectus abdominis muscle
2. the ilioinguinal and iliohypogastric nerves arise from the anterior ramus of the first lumbar spinal nerve
	- Lumbar plexus
		-  ![[Pasted image 20230513053701.png]]
	- They emerge lateral to the psoas muscle and travel retroperitoneally across the quadratus lumborum inferomedially toward the iliac crest. Near this crest, both nerves pierce the transversus abdominis muscle and course ventromedially. At a site 2 to 3 cm medial to the anterior superior iliac spine, the nerves then pierce the internal oblique muscle and course superficial to it toward the midline 
	- iliohypogastric nerve perforates the external oblique aponeuroses to supply the skin over the suprapubic area.
	- ilioinguinal nerve travels through the Inguinal canal and exits through the superficial inguinal ring and supply the skin over mons pubis, upper labia majora and medial upper thigh.
	- *surgical significance* -> both these nerves can be severed during a low transverse Incision or entrapped during closure, especially if incision is extended beyond the lateral borders of the rectus abdominis muscle, thus resulting in loss of sensation over skin as they carry only sensory Information.

## Hesselbach's triangle
- ![[Pasted image 20230513060427.png]]
- Hesselbach triangle is the region bounded laterally by the inferior epigastric vessels, inferiorly by the inguinal ligament, and medially by the lateral border of the rectus abdominis muscle. 
	- Hernias that protrude through the abdominal wall in Hesselbach triangle are termed direct inguinal hernias. 
	- In contrast, indirect inguinal hernias do so through the deep inguinal ring, which lies lateral to this triangle, and then may exit out the superficial inguinal ring.
