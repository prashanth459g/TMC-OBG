# History 

## Progesterone
- The corpus luteum was first discovered in 1672 by Reinier de Graaf and named in 1689 by Marcelo Malpighi. Malpighi proposed that the corpus luteum produces the ovarian follicles and that the yellow substance, like egg yolk, serves to nourish the ovum . 
- In 1903, Fraenkel demonstrated that the removal of the corpora lutea of rabbits before implantation, prevented implantation. Moreover, luteectomy in early pregnancy (<14 days) resulted in pregnancy loss. 
- In 1929, Corner and W.M. Allen described that injecting extracts of the corpus luteum into castrated adult female rabbits induces a characteristic alteration of the endometrium identical to progestational proliferation, previously shown to be due to the presence of corpora lutea in the ovaries. In a second report, Allen and Corner demonstrated that in ovariectomized rabbits (at the 18th hour of pregnancy), the presence of **progestational proliferation** induced by corpus luteum extracts may sustain normal implantation as well as embryo survival and growth; whereas in the absence of progestational proliferation the embryos never survived beyond the fourth day. Therefore, the extracts of corpus luteum were essential for both implantation and early pregnancy maintenance. 
	- In 1930, ==Allen proposed the name “progestin”== to refer to the hormone responsible for these biological effects, 
	- and the race for the isolation of this hormone ended in 1934 when four different groups reported its purification and characterization. Each group suggested a different name to refer to the main corpus luteum hormone, and the name “progesterone” came by consensus after a meeting of the League of Nation’s Health Organization in 1935.
