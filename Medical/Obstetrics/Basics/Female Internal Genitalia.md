# Female Internal Genitalia

## Uterus
- The nonpregnant uterus lies in the pelvic cavity between the bladder anteriorly and the rectum posteriorly. 
- Almost the entire posterior wall of the uterus is covered by serosa, that is, visceral peritoneum. The lower portion of this peritoneum forms the anterior boundary of the rectouterine cul-de-sac, or **pouch of Douglas**. 
- Only the upper portion of the anterior uterine wall is covered by visceral peritoneum. At the caudal border of this portion, the peritoneum reflects forward onto the bladder dome to create the **vesicouterine pouch**. As a result, the lower portion of the anterior uterine wall is separated from the posterior wall of the bladder only by a well-defined loose connective tissue layer—the **vesicouterine space**. 
	- Clinically, during cesarean delivery, the peritoneum of the vesicouterine pouch is sharply incised, and the vesicouterine space is entered. Dissection caudally within this space lifts the bladder safely off the lower uterine segment for hysterotomy and delivery.

- The uterus is pear shaped and consists of two major but unequal parts. 
	- The upper, larger portion is the body or corpus, whereas the lower smaller cervix projects into the vagina. 
	- The ==isthmus ==is the union site of these two. It is of special obstetrical significance because it forms the lower uterine segment during pregnancy. 
- At each superolateral margin of the body is a uterine cornu, from which a fallopian tube emerges. This area also contains the origins of the round and ovarian ligaments. Between the points of fallopian tube insertion is the convex upper uterine segment termed the fundus. 
- The bulk of the uterine body, but not the cervix, is muscle. The inner surfaces of the anterior and posterior walls lie almost in contact, and the cavity between these walls forms a mere slit. The nulligravid uterus measures 6 to 8 cm in length compared with 9 to 10 cm in multiparas. The uterus averages 60 g and typically weighs more in parous women (Langlois, 1970; Sheikhazadi, 2010). 
- Pregnancy stimulates remarkable uterine growth due to <u>muscle fiber hypertrophy</u>. The uterine fundus, a previously flattened convexity between tubal insertions, now becomes dome shaped. Moreover, the round ligaments appear to insert at the junction of the middle and upper thirds of the organ. The fallopian tubes elongate, but the ovaries grossly appear unchanged. 
### Cervix 
- This portion of the uterus is cylindrical and has small apertures at each end—the internal and external cervical ora. The endocervical canal runs through the cervix and connects these ora. 
- The cervix is divided into upper and lower portions by the vagina’s attachment to its outer surface. The upper portion—the ==portio supravaginalis== - begins at the internal os, which corresponds to the level at which the peritoneum is reflected up onto the bladder. The lower cervical portion protrudes into the vagina as the ==portio vaginalis==. 
- Before childbirth, the external cervical os is a small, regular, **oval** opening. After labor, especially vaginal childbirth, the orifice is converted into a **transverse slit** that is divided such that there are the so-called anterior and posterior cervical lips. If torn deeply during labor or delivery, the cervix may heal in such a manner that it appears irregular, nodular, or stellate. 
- #histology  The cervical surface that radially surrounds the external os is called the ==ectocervix== and is lined predominantly by nonkeratinized stratified squamous epithelium. In contrast, the ==endocervical canal== is covered by a single layer of mucin-secreting columnar epithelium, which creates deep cleftlike infoldings or “glands.” 
	- Commonly during pregnancy, the endocervical epithelium moves out and onto the ectocervix in a physiological process termed eversion. The cervical stroma is composed mainly of collagen, elastin, and proteoglycans, but very little smooth muscle. changes in the amount, composition, and orientation of these components lead to cervical ripening prior to labor onset. 
	- In early pregnancy, increased vascularity within the cervix stroma beneath the epithelium creates an ectocervical blue tint that is characteristic of ==Chadwick sign==. 
	- Cervical edema leads to softening—==Goodell sign==, whereas isthmic softening is ==Hegar sign==. 
### Myometrium and Endometrium 
- Most of the uterus is composed of myometrium, which contains smooth muscle bundles united by connective tissue with many elastic fibers. Interlacing myometrial fibers surround myometrial vessels and contract to compress these. This anatomy allows hemostasis at the placental site during the third stage of labor.
- The number of myometrial muscle fibers varies by location (Schwalm, 1966). Levels progressively diminish caudally such that, in the cervix, muscle makes up only 10 percent of the tissue mass. The uterine body’s inner wall has relatively more muscle than its outer layers. And, in the anterior and posterior walls, the muscle content is greater than in the lateral walls. During pregnancy, the upper myometrium undergoes marked hypertrophy, but cervical muscle content does not change significantly. 
- The uterine cavity is lined with endometrium, which is composed of an overlying epithelium, invaginating glands, and a supportive, vascular stroma. the endometrium varies greatly throughout the menstrual cycle. This layer is divided into a **functionalis** layer, which is sloughed with menses, and a **basalis** layer, which serves to regenerate the functionalis layer following each menses. During pregnancy, the endometrium is termed **decidua** and undergoes dramatic hormonally driven alterations. 
## Ligaments 
- Several ligaments extend from the uterine surface toward the pelvic sidewalls and include the round, broad, cardinal, and uterosacral ligaments. Despite their appellation, the round and broad ligaments provide no substantial uterine support, which contrasts with the cardinal and uterosacral ligaments.

- The round ligament originates somewhat below and anterior to the origin of the fallopian tubes. Clinically, this orientation can aid fallopian tube identification during puerperal sterilization. This is important if pelvic adhesions limit tubal mobility and thus, hinder fimbria visualization and tubal confirmation prior to ligation. 
	- Each round ligament extends laterally and down into the inguinal canal, through which it passes, to terminate in the upper portion of the ipsilateral labium majus. 
	- ==Sampson artery==, a branch of the uterine artery, runs within this ligament. 
	- In nonpregnant women, the round ligament varies from 3 to 5 mm in diameter and is composed of smooth muscle bundles separated by fibrous tissue septa (Mahran, 1965). During pregnancy, these ligaments undergo considerable hypertrophy and increase appreciably in both length and diameter. 
- The broad ligaments are two winglike structures that extend from the lateral uterine margins to the pelvic sidewalls. Each broad ligament consists of a double- layer drape of peritoneum. The anterior and posterior layers of this drape are termed the anterior and posterior leaves, respectively. In forming the broad ligament, this peritoneum folds over structures extending from each cornu. 
	- Peritoneum that folds over the fallopian tube is termed the **mesosalpinx**, that around the round ligament is the **mesoteres**, and that over the ovarian ligament is the **mesovarium**. Peritoneum that extends beneath the fimbriated end of the fallopian tube toward the pelvic wall forms the **suspensory ligament or the infundibulopelvic ligament of the ovary**. This contains nerves and the ovarian vessels, and during pregnancy, these vessels, especially the venous plexuses, are dramatically enlarged. Specifically, the diameter of the ovarian vascular pedicle increases from 0.9 cm to reach 2.6 cm at term (Hodgkinson, 1953). 
- The cardinal ligament—also called the transverse cervical ligament or ==Mackenrodt ligament==—anchors medially to the uterus and upper vagina. The cardinal ligament is the thick base of the broad ligament. As such, during cesarean hysterectomy, sturdy clamps and suture are required for its transection and ligation. 
- Each uterosacral ligament originates with a posterolateral attachment to the supravaginal portion of the cervix and inserts into the fascia over the sacrum, with some variations (Ramanah, 2012; Umek, 2004). These ligaments are composed of connective tissue, small bundles of vessels and nerves, and some smooth muscle. Covered by peritoneum, these ligaments *form the lateral boundaries of the pouch of Douglas*. 
- The term ==parametrium== is used to describe the connective tissues adjacent and lateral to the uterus within the broad ligament. ==Paracervical== tissues are those adjacent to the cervix, whereas ==paracolpium== is that tissue lateral to the vaginal walls. 
## Pelvic Blood Supply 
- During pregnancy, there is marked hypertrophy of the uterine vasculature, which is supplied principally from the uterine and ovarian arteries. The uterine artery, a main branch of the internal iliac artery—previously called the hypogastric artery—enters the base of the broad ligament. The uterine artery courses medially to the lateral side of the uterus. Approximately 2 cm lateral to the cervix, the uterine artery crosses over the ureter. This proximity is of great surgical significance, as the ureter may be injured or ligated during hysterectomy when the uterine vessels are clamped and ligated. Once the uterine artery has reached the supravaginal portion of the cervix, it divides. The smaller cervicovaginal artery supplies blood to the lower cervix and upper vagina. The main uterine artery branch turns abruptly upward and travels cephalad along the lateral margin of the uterus. Along its path, this main artery provides a branch of considerable size to the upper cervix and then numerous other medial branches serially penetrate the body of the uterus to form the arcuate arteries. As indicated by the name, each branch arches across the organ by coursing within the myometrium just beneath the serosal surface. Arcuate vessels from each side anastomose at the uterine midline. Radial artery branches originate at right
angles from the arcuate arteries and travel inward through the myometrium, enter the endometrium/decidua, and branch there to become either basal arteries or coiled spiral arteries. The spiral arteries supply the functionalis layer. Also called the straight arteries, the basal arteries extend only into the basalis layer. As the uterine artery courses cephalad, it gives rise to Sampson artery of the round ligament. Just before the main uterine artery vessel reaches the fallopian tube, it divides into three terminal branches. The ovarian branch of the uterine artery forms an anastomosis with the terminal branch of the ovarian artery; the tubal branch makes its way through the mesosalpinx and supplies part of the fallopian tube; and the fundal branch penetrates the uppermost uterus. In addition to the uterine artery, the uterus receives blood supply from the ovarian artery (see Fig. 2-10). This artery is a direct branch of the aorta and enters the broad ligament through the infundibulopelvic ligament. At the ovarian hilum, it divides into smaller branches that enter the ovary. As the ovarian artery runs along the hilum, it also sends several branches through the mesosalpinx to supply the fallopian tubes. Its main stem, however, traverses the entire length of the broad ligament toward the uterine cornu. Here, it forms an anastomosis with the ovarian branch of the uterine artery. This dual uterine blood supply creates a vascular reserve to prevent uterine ischemia if ligation of the uterine or internal iliac artery is performed to control postpartum hemorrhage. Uterine veins accompany their respective arteries. As such, the arcuate veins unite to form the uterine vein, which empties into the internal iliac vein and then the common iliac vein. Some of the blood from the upper uterus, the ovary, and the upper part of the broad ligament is collected by several veins. Within the broad ligament, these veins form the large pampiniform plexus that terminates in the ovarian vein. From here, the right ovarian vein empties into the vena cava, whereas the left ovarian vein empties into the left renal vein. Blood supply to the pelvis is predominantly provided by branches of the internal iliac artery (Fig. 2-12). These branches are organized into anterior and posterior divisions, and subsequent branches are highly variable between individuals. The anterior division provides blood supply to the pelvic organs and perineum and includes the inferior gluteal, internal pudendal, middle rectal, vaginal, uterine, and obturator arteries, as well as the umbilical artery and its continuation as the superior vesical artery. The posterior division branches extend to the buttock and thigh and include the superior gluteal, lateral sacral, and iliolumbar arteries. For this reason, during internal iliac artery ligation, many advocate ligation distal to the posterior division to avoid compromised blood flow to the areas supplied by this division (Bleich, 2007).

Pelvic Lymphatics The lymphatics from the uterine corpus are distributed to two groups of nodes. One set of vessels drains into the internal iliac nodes. The other set, after joining lymphatics from the ovarian region, terminates in the paraaortic lymph nodes. Lymphatics from the cervix terminate mainly in the internal iliac nodes, which are situated near the bifurcation of the common iliac vessels. Pelvic Innervation As a brief review, the peripheral nervous system is divided into a somatic division, which innervates skeletal muscle, and an autonomic division, which innervates smooth muscle, cardiac muscle, and glands. Pelvic visceral innervation is predominantly autonomic, which is further divided into sympathetic and parasympathetic components. Sympathetic innervation to pelvic viscera begins with the superior hypogastric plexus, also termed the presacral nerve (Fig. 2-13). Beginning below the aortic bifurcation and extending downward retroperitoneally, this plexus is formed by
sympathetic fibers arising from spinal levels T10 through L2. At the level of the sacral promontory, this superior hypogastric plexus divides into a right and a left hypogastric nerve, which run downward along the pelvis sidewalls (Ripperda, 2015). FIGURE 2-13 Pelvic innervation. (Reproduced with permission from Corton MM: Anatomy. In Hoffman BL, Schorge JO, Bradshaw KD, et al (eds): Williams Gynecology, 3rd ed. New York, McGraw-Hill Education, 2016.) In contrast, parasympathetic innervation to the pelvic viscera derives from neurons at spinal levels S2 through S4. Their axons exit as part of the anterior rami of the spinal nerves for those levels. These combine on each side to form the pelvic splanchnic nerves, also termed nervi erigentes. Blending of the two hypogastric nerves (sympathetic) and the two pelvic splanchnic nerves (parasympathetic) gives rise to the inferior hypogastric plexus, also termed the pelvic plexus. This retroperitoneal plaque of nerves lies at the S4 and S5 level (Spackman, 2007). From here, fibers of this plexus accompany internal iliac artery branches to their respective pelvic viscera. Thus, the inferior hypogastric plexus divides into three plexuses. The vesical plexus innervates the bladder, and the middle rectal plexus travels to the rectum. The uterovaginal
plexus, also termed Frankenhäuser plexus, reaches the proximal fallopian tubes, uterus, and upper vagina. Extensions of the inferior hypogastric plexus also reach the perineum along the vagina and urethra to innervate the clitoris and vestibular bulbs (Montoya, 2011). Of these, the uterovaginal plexus is composed of variably sized ganglia, but particularly of a large ganglionic plate that is situated on either side of the cervix, proximate to the uterosacral and cardinal ligaments (Ramanah, 2012). For the uterus, most of its afferent sensory fibers ascend through the inferior hypogastric plexus and enter the spinal cord via T10 through T12 and L1 spinal nerves. These transmit the painful stimuli of contractions to the central nervous system. For the cervix and upper part of the birth canal, sensory nerves pass through the pelvic splanchnic nerves to the second, third, and fourth sacral nerves. Last, those from the lower portion of the birth canal pass primarily through the pudendal nerve. Anesthetic blocks used during delivery target these levels of innervation. Ovaries Along the pelvic sidewall, each ovary usually rests in the ovarian fossa of Waldeyer, which is a slight depression between the external and internal iliac vessels. During childbearing years, ovaries variably measure 2.5 to 5 cm in length, 1.5 to 3 cm in width, and 0.6 to 1.5 cm in thickness. The ovarian ligament, also called the uteroovarian ligament, originates from the upper posterolateral portion of the uterus, just beneath the tubal insertion level, and extends to the uterine pole of the ovary (see Fig. 2-10). Measuring a few centimeters long and 3 to 4 mm in diameter, this ligament is made up of muscle and connective tissue and is covered by peritoneum—the mesovarium. Blood supply reaches the ovary through this double-layered mesovarium to enter the ovarian hilum. The ovary consists of an outer cortex and inner medulla. In young women, the cortex is smooth, has a dull white surface, and is lined by single layer of cuboidal epithelium, the germinal epithelium of Waldeyer. This epithelium is supported by a connective tissue condensation, the tunica albuginea. Beneath this, the ovarian cortex contains oocytes and developing follicles. The medulla is composed of loose connective tissue, numerous arteries and veins, and a small amount of smooth muscle fibers. The ovaries are supplied with both sympathetic and parasympathetic nerves. The sympathetic nerves are derived primarily from the ovarian plexus that accompanies the ovarian vessels and originates in the renal plexus. Others are derived from the plexus that surrounds the ovarian branch of the uterine artery. Parasympathetic input is from the vagus nerve. Sensory afferents follow the ovarian artery and enter at T10 spinal cord level.
Fallopian Tubes Also called oviducts, these serpentine tubes extend laterally 8 to 14 cm from the uterine cornua. They are anatomically classified along their length as an interstitial portion, isthmus, ampulla, and infundibulum (Fig. 2-14). Most proximal, the interstitial portion is embodied within the uterine muscular wall. Next, the narrow 2- to 3-mm wide isthmus widens gradually into the 5- to 8-mm wide ampulla. Last, the infundibulum is the funnel-shaped fimbriated distal extremity of the tube, which opens into the abdominal cavity. These latter three extrauterine portions are covered by the mesosalpinx at the superior margin of the broad ligament.

Below these are photographs of corresponding histological sections. (Used with permission from Dr. Kelley S. Carrick.)
In cross section, the extrauterine fallopian tube contains a mesosalpinx, myosalpinx, and endosalpinx. The outer of these, the mesosalpinx, is a single-cell mesothelial layer functioning as visceral peritoneum. In the myosalpinx, smooth muscle is arranged in an inner circular and an outer longitudinal layer. The tubal musculature undergoes rhythmic contractions constantly, the rate of which varies with cyclical ovarian hormonal changes. The tubal mucosa or endosalpinx is a single layer of columnar epithelium composed of ciliated, secretory, and intercalary cells resting on a sparse lamina propria. Clinically, its close proximity to the underlying myosalpinx contributes to easy invasion by ectopic trophoblast. The tubal mucosa is arranged in longitudinal folds that become progressively more complex toward the fimbria. In the ampulla, the lumen is occupied almost completely by the arborescent mucosa. The current produced by the tubal cilia is such that the direction of flow is toward the uterine cavity. Tubal peristalsis created by cilia and muscular layer contraction is believed to be an important factor in ovum transport (Croxatto, 2002). The tubes are supplied richly with elastic tissue, blood vessels, and lymphatics. Their sympathetic innervation is extensive, in contrast to their parasympathetic innervation. This nerve supply derives partly from the ovarian plexus and partly from the uterovaginal plexus. Sensory afferent fibers ascend to T10 spinal cord levels.
