	- Genital ducts ![[Pasted image 20230805180152.png]] ^90ae3d
	- 
- [[Gonads]] begin to develop when the embryo has a crown-rump length of 5–7 mm, in the fifth week of pregnancy 
	- The longitudinal swelling on both sides of the primitive mesentery, which encloses the mesonephros and the primitive gonad internally, is the **urogenital ridge**
	- The somatic cells of the gonads are derived from mesonephric cells, which migrate into the area of the genital ridge early in development, and also from the ==mesenchyme== and overlying ==coelomic epithelium==
	- gonocytes or germ cells arrive at the gonadal ridge from the yolk sac, attracted by a chemotactic factor or *teloferon*.
	- Since the XX gonocytes arrive at the gonadal ridge later than the XY gonocytes (around the 10th–12th week), the wave of primary sexual cords has already passed and form the rete ovarii in the medullary region of the gonad. #half_understood😓 
		- Now, in the absence of the Y chromosome, the male HY histocompatibility antigen and TDF/SRY gene (Sex-determining region of the Y chromosome gene) (but probably in the presence of HX antigen), the secondary sexual cords individually include each gonocyte in the cortical region of the gonad, generating ==primordial follicles== and the cells of those cords differentiate into granulosa cells. ![[Pasted image 20230805180311.png]]
		- Follicles fail to form in the absence of oocytes or with precious loss of germ cells, and oocytes not encompassed by follicular cells degenerate
- [[Female Internal Genitalia]] 
	- The internal genitals begin their formation in the sixth week
		- During the 12th week, the two mullerian ducts fuse to the uterovaginal canal. Subsequent canalization of each individual duct leads to a septate uterovaginal precursor. At the 20th week, the septum is absorbed, yielding the uterus and the upper vagina. The lower vagina is formed out of the absorption of the vaginal plate which in turn came out of the sinovaginal bulbs after the fusion of the caudal part of the mullerian ducts
	- In the thickness of the urogenital ridge, the mesonephric excretory tubules converge in a mesonephric or wolffian duct that descends to the cloacae in the urogenital sinus. 
	- Meanwhile, a longitudinal invagination of the celomic epithelium is formed on the outer side of the urogenital ridge and originates the paramesonephric or Müller’s duct. 
		- This one, at the top, opens into the celomic cavity, descends in parallel, and externally to the mesonephric duct, crossing it then ventrally, growing in the caudomedial direction until fusing and forming in the middle line a Y shape structure that is the uterine primordium, without reaching the urogenital sinus
		- *Three* portions can be distinguished in the müllerian ducts: a superior converging, a middle fused and an inferior diverging portion. ![[Anatomy#^90ae3d]]
			- In any case, the most proximate part is the uterine isthmus at the internal cervical os level . 
			- The lower diverging parts of these `para`mesonephric ducts fuse with the medial wall of the `mesonephric` ones inside a common basal membrane, and then, caudal to the end portion of the Müller ducts, over the dorsal wall of the urogenital sinus, an accumulation of paramesonephric cells which constitute the Müller tubercle can be observed.
				- This Müller tubercle is then delimited laterally by the Wolff ducts . These mesonephric or Wolffian ducts, close medially, do open into the urogenital sinus, and from the caudal tip of their opening, the ureteral buds sprout in each side and, growing laterally, anteriorly and cranially, move toward the metanephros to form the definitive kidney
				- ![[Pasted image 20230805182321.png]]
		- When the ovary is being formed, and therefore the testosterone and the AMH are absent, the Wolffian ducts become atretic and the Müllerian ones develop. The fused caudal parts of the paramesonephric ducts form the uterus, and the tubes come from the uppermost part that remains separated and opened into the celomic cavity. 
		- However, the adequate development and fusion of the paramesonephric ducts, the reabsorption of the middle septum and the correct formation of the normal uterus is induced by the laterally situated mesonephric ducts. The fusion and reabsorption processes begin at the uterine isthmus and progress simultaneously in both cranial and caudal directions
- Urinary system
	- The development of the urinary system is intimately associated with that of the genital tract and occurs between the sixth and ninth week
	- The metanephrogenic mass is formed in the intermediate mesoderm, caudally to the mesonephros, and is induced by the metanephric diverticulum or ureteral bud that has sprouted from the dorsal side of the mesonephric duct in its opening into the urogenital sinus. The ureteral bud forms the ureter and from its cranial part it expands to form the renal pelvis in the metanephrogenic mass.
	- urogenital wedge
		- The bladder and the urethra sprout from the urogenital sinus and adjacent mesenquima, though the ventrocraneal part of the bladder comes from the allantoids. After the division of the cloacae by the urorectal septum, the formation of the rectum and superior anal duct dorsally and urogenital sinus ventrally occurs . In the inferior part of the urogenital sinus, in front of the urorectal septum, the mesonephric ducts open, and the bladder is formed ventrally which incorporates the allantoids. Gradually, the bladder ascends and the most caudal part of the mesonephric ducts with the ureteral bud (what has been named the “Wolffi an patch”) ends up incorporated into the dorsal wall. Like this, the ureters are incorporated and remain, opening themselves separately, in the adult vesical trigone. 
		- Now, the growing of a new urogenital fold (the urogenital wedge) fi nally separates the bladder and the urethra anterior and ventrally, while the mesonephric ducts continue opening into the lower side of the urogenital sinus ![[Pasted image 20230805183201.png]]
- [[Female External Genitalia]]
	- The development of the external genitalia begins in the fourth week with the formation of the genital tubercle in the ventral portion of the cloacal membrane, but the fi nal aspect is not established until the 12th week. Genital swellings and urogenital or urethral folds appear on each side soon after, and between both folds is the urogenital groove and membrane.
	- The genital tubercle forms the phallus, which in absence of male inductors becomes the clitoris, while the genital folds form the labia majora. The urogenital or urethral folds do not fuse and form the labia minora. The urogenital groove remains open hence forming the introitum, where the urethra, and later the vagina, will open after the fenestration of the urogenital membrane; and the remnants of that membrane will be the hymen

	- Vagina
		- its upper part comes from the Müller ducts (müllerian vagina) and the lower part from the urogenital sinus (sinus vagina), though always assuming the inducing function of the mesonephric ducts in the appropriate müllerian development %% However, apart from the inducing role of the mesonephric ducts on the Müllerian ducts, different studies, some of them experimental, have proved their participation in the formation of the vagina, *so that the “protrusions of the sinus” or the “sinuvaginal bulbs” observed during the development of the vagina would actually be the caudal segments of the Wolffian ducts*. Certainly, Hart had already adopted the term “Wolffian bulb” because the epithelial pockets that form the sinuvaginal bulbs keep remnants of the wolffian ducts.%%
		- Upcoming embryological Hypothesis -> The vagina seems to come completely from the fused mesonephric ducts, though the Müller tubercle would also take part and is fundamental for its adequate formation and cavitation
			- According to this embryological hypothesis, the fused Müller ducts would form the uterus until the external cervical orifice, induced by the mesonephric ducts that descend at both sides and to which they caudally fuse after their divergence. Later, the mesonephric ducts regress cranially but from the level of the external cervical os, they enlarge and form the sinuvaginal bulbs, incorporating the Müller tubercle’s cells to the vaginal plate formed by the fusion of both bulbs. ![[Pasted image 20230808020100.png]]
			- Likewise, the Müller tubercle would be delimited at the top and laterally by the diverging portion of the Müller ducts, more laterally by the Wolffi an ducts, infero-laterally by the portion of the sinuvaginal bulbs and below by the urogenital sinus 
			- The posterior cavitation of the Müller tubercle lets the müllerian cells cover the primitive vaginal cavity with a cuboidal or paramesonephric epithelium. Then, by metaplasic induction or, more probably, by epidermization from the urogenital sinus, the vagina becomes lined by a fl at, squamous, polystratified epithelium. Some mesonephric remnants may remain in the vaginal wall, which occasionally can give rise to Gartner cysts.
- The Gubernaculum
	- The gubernaculum forms from the caudal fold that provokes the mesonephros elevating the covering peritoneum. It begins as a cord that extends from the gonadal ridge, to the future inguinal region and its insertion into the urogenital cord differentiates two portions of the Müller duct. 
	- In the absence of testicular differentiation that is, in the absence of androgens and AMH and presence of ovary formation, the paramesonephric or Müllerian ducts complete their invagination and development, interfering the connection of this tissular column that has arisen from the inguinal cone with the mesonephric duct and the caudal ligament of the gonad. The gubernaculum then grows over the paramesonephric ducts, and its muscular fibres incorporate into the wall of the Müllerian ducts, becoming the round ligament. 
	- Behind and above, in the absence of androgens and AMH, only athretic remnants of the mesonephric duct remain; thus, the caudal ligament, uniting the gonad inferior pole to the posterior wall of the Müllerian ducts, constitutes the uteroovarian ligament. 
	- The Müllerian ducts continue their development, and induced by the mesonephric ducts, complete the fusion process, the reabsorption of the middle septum and the appropriate formation of the uterus. It remains unclear whether the growth of the female gubernaculum and its fusion with the developing Müllerian ducts could be one of the most important processes in the induction of the formation of the uterus, but it has been suggested that a gubernaculum anomaly could lead to certain genital malformations and a fusion defect between the müllerian ducts
