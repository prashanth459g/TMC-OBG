# Abortion

### Threatened Abortion
- This diagnosis is presumed when bloody vaginal discharge or bleeding appears through a closed cervical os during the first 20 weeks.

- With a robust uterine pregnancy, serum β-hCG levels should rise at least 53 to 66 percent every 48 hours 
	- Although a less-used marker, serum progesterone concentrations <5 ng/mL suggest a dying pregnancy. 
	- Values >20 ng/mL support the diagnosis of a healthy one.
- Transvaginal sonography is used to locate the pregnancy and determine viability.
- β-HCG threshold as high as 3500 mIU/mL may be needed to identify the gestational sac in some cases that ultimately yield a viable singleton IUP.
	- **Pseudogestational sac**
		- This pseudosac may be blood derived from a bleeding ectopic pregnancy and is easier to exclude once a yolk sac is seen. Typically, the yolk sac is visible by 5.5 weeks and with a mean gestational-sac diameter of 10 mm. Thus, the diagnosis of an IUP should be made cautiously if the yolk sac is not yet seen


### Incomplete Abortion
- During abortion, bleeding follows partial or complete placental separation and dilation of the cervical os
- tissue may remain entirely within the uterus or partially extrude through the cervix. Products lying loosely within the cervical canal can be easily extracted with ring forceps. 
- In contrast, with incomplete expulsion, three management options include curettage, expectant management, or misoprostol (Cytotec), which is prostaglandin E1
	- curettage usually results in a quick resolution that is 95 to 100 percent successful. However, it is invasive and not necessary for all women.


### Complete Abortion
- At times, complete expulsion of the entire pregnancy may ensue, and the cervical os subsequently closes. A history of heavy bleeding, cramping, and passage of tissue is typical.
- complete abortion cannot be surely diagnosed unless:
	1. true products of conception are seen grossly
	2. unless sonography confidently documents first an intrauterine pregnancy and then later an empty cavity.



### Missed Abortion
- Guidelines for Early Pregnancy Loss Diagnosis
	- Sonographic Findings
		- CRL ≥ 7 mm and no heartbeat
		- MSD ≥ 25 mm and no embryo
		- An initial US scan shows a gestational sac with yolk sac, and after ==≥ 11 days== no embryo with a heartbeat is seen
		- An initial US scan shows a gestational sac *without* a yolk sac, and after ==≥ 2 weeks== no embryo with a heartbeat is seen
	- Modalities
		- Transvaginal preferable to transabdominal US
		- M-mode imaging used to document and measure heartbeat
- other softer sonographic markers may portend early pregnancy failure. (other than guidelines)
	- Values for yolk sac diameters(measured inner-to-inner ring) for each gestational week in normal pregnancy have been established. Yolk sac diameters ≥6 mm in pregnancies <10 weeks’ gestation are suspicious for pregnancy failure 
	- Normal -> The fetal heart rate in the first trimester rises from 110 to 130 beats per minute (bpm) at 6 weeks’ gestation to 160 to 170 bpm at 8 weeks
	- A slower heart rate is unfavorable, especially those <85 bpm
- Treatment 
	- misoprostol can be given to hasten uterine evacuation. A single 800-μg dose vaginally is a common standard
		- It may be repeated in 1 to 2 days
		- failure rates range from 15 to 40 percent
- Confirmation of completion may include a history of heavy bleeding, cramping, and tissue passage followed by ebbing flow; a sonographically thin endometrial thickness; and rapidly dropping serum hCG levels. 
	- That said, there is no consensus on an endometrial thickness threshold that mandates additional intervention.
### Inevitable Abortion
- Preterm premature rupture of membranes (PPROM) at a **previable gestational age** complicates 0.5 percent of pregnancies (Hunter, 2012). Rupture may be spontaneous or may follow an invasive procedure such as amniocentesis or fetal surgery.
	- #MedTech/Solution amniopatch—can be created by intraamnionic instillation of autologous platelets and cryoprecipitate. Considered investigational, it is used to seal some surgical leaks
- Spontaneous rupture in the first trimester is nearly always followed by either uterine contractions or infection, and termination is typical.
- In some second- trimester cases not associated with pain, fever, or bleeding, fluid may have collected previously between the amnion and chorion. If this is documented, then diminished activity with observation is reasonable. After 48 hours, if no additional amnionic fluid has escaped and if there is no bleeding, cramping, or fever, then a woman may resume ambulation and pelvic rest at home.
	- PPROM at a previable age, 40 to 50 percent of women will deliver within the first week, and 70 to 80 percent will do so after 2 to 5 weeks (American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, 2016f). Average latency is 2 weeks
	- Significant maternal complications attend previable PPROM and include chorioamnionitis, endometritis, sepsis, placental abruption, and retained placenta (Waters, 2009). With bleeding, cramping, or fever, abortion is considered inevitable, and the uterus is evacuated.
	- Neonatal mortality predominantly stems from pulmonary dysfunction, which has higher rates when oligohydramnios persists
