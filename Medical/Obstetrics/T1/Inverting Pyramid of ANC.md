# Inverting Pyramid of ANC
- Most of the Chromosomal & structural defect can be diagnosed by the end of [[T1]]
- cell free fDNA is a significant advance in diagnosing aneuploids
- Risk of some pregnancy complications that become clinically evident only later in pregnancy can be established in [[T1]], incidence of few of these like Preeclampsia can be reduced if treatment instituted in early ðŸ¤° 
	- screening also shows some promises in predicting - FGR without preeclampsia, preterm birth, Macrosomia, GDM

	- 3 parts of risk profiling ![[Pasted image 20230627233133.png]] 
	- implications of early assessments of patient specific risk for preeclampsia
		- direct patient to specialist clinic for close surveillance
			- early diagnosis, decision making for delivery
		- Starting ASPIRIN in #T1 
			- it can potentially halve the incident of Preeclampsia
- Preterm birth screening
	- Risk factors - Multiple pregnancy, previous spontaneous preterm, short cervix at 12wk
- Chorionicity
- Double marker - NT, NB, DV, TR

- Whom to screen
	- Age is not enough ![[Pasted image 20230627225651.png]]
- When to screen?
	- CRL between 45-84Â mm
	- GA between 11 - 13+6wk
