# Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy
- Together with haemorrhage and infection, hypertension forms the deadly triad that contributes to morbidity and mortality during pregnancy and childbirth.
- Hypertensive disorders are responsible for not only maternal deaths but also substantial morbidity for the pregnant women. 
	- One-third of severe maternal morbidity was a consequence of hypertensive conditions in UK.
	- Long-term impact of hypertension in pregnancy in the form of chronic hypertension and increased lifetime cardiovascular risk is also present.
- Hypertensive disorders also carry a risk for the baby. 
	- Hypertension and/or proteinuria is the leading single identifiable risk factor in pregnancy associated with stillbirth. %%In the most recent UK perinatal mortality report, 1 in 20 (5%) stillbirths in infants without congenital abnormality occurred in women with preeclampsia. %%
	- Preeclampsia is strongly associated with fetal growth restriction, low birthweight, spontaneous or iatrogenic preterm delivery, respiratory distress syndrome and admission to neonatal intensive care.
	- Growth restriction arising from placental disease is common
## Preeclampsia 
- Preeclampsia is a `multisystem progressive disorder` characterized by the new onset of hypertension and proteinuria or the new onset of hypertension and significant end-organ dysfunction with or without proteinuria in the last half of pregnancy or postpartum. 
	- It is caused by placental and maternal vascular dysfunction and resolves after birth over a variable period of time. 
	- Although approximately 90 percent of cases present in the late preterm (≥34 to <37 weeks), term (≥37 to <42 weeks), or postpartum (≥42 weeks) period and have good maternal, fetal, and newborn outcomes, the mother and child are still at increased risk for serious morbidity or mortality. 
	- The remaining 10 percent of cases have an early presentation (<34 weeks) and carry the additional high risks associated with moderately preterm, very preterm, or extremely preterm birth. 
	- Long-term, patients with preeclampsia are at increased risk for developing cardiovascular and renal disease.

- During pregnancy, hypertension is defined as systolic blood pressure ≥140 mmHg and/or diastolic blood pressure ≥90 mmHg. 
	- Severe hypertension is defined as systolic blood pressure ≥160 mmHg and/or diastolic blood pressure ≥110 mmHg.
- Chronic hypertension is defined as hypertension that precedes pregnancy or is present on at least two occasions before the 20th week of gestation or persists longer than 12 weeks postpartum. It can be primary or secondary to a variety of medical disorders. 
- The diagnosis of **preeclampsia with severe features (formerly severe preeclampsia)** is made in the subset of patients with preeclampsia who have severe hypertension and/or specific signs or symptoms of significant end-organ dysfunction that signify the severe end of the preeclampsia spectrum. 
	- In 2013, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists removed proteinuria as an essential criterion for the diagnosis of preeclampsia (hypertension plus signs of significant end-organ dysfunction are sufficient for diagnosis). 
	- They also removed massive proteinuria (5 g/24 hours) and fetal growth restriction (FGR) as possible features of severe disease because massive proteinuria has a poor correlation with outcome, and FGR is managed similarly whether or not preeclampsia is diagnosed. 
	- Oliguria was also removed as a characteristic of severe disease. 
	- The International Society for the Study of Hypertension in Pregnancy continues to include FGR as one of the criteria that can establish a diagnosis of preeclampsia in a patient with new-onset hypertension after 20 weeks of gestation since both preeclampsia and growth restriction are manifestations of a primary placental disorder

# Definition 
- **Gestational hypertension**
	-   New onset of systolic blood pressure ≥140 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure ≥90 mmHg on at least 2 occasions 4 hours apart after 20 weeks of gestation in a previously normotensive individual
	- *And:*
		-   No proteinuria
		-   No severe features of preeclampsia (thrombocytopenia, renal insufficiency, elevated liver transaminases, pulmonary edema, cerebral or visual symptoms)
- **Preeclampsia**
	-   New onset of systolic blood pressure ≥140 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure ≥90 mmHg on at least 2 occasions at least 4 hours apart after 20 weeks of gestation in a previously normotensive individual **or** systolic blood pressure ≥160 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure ≥110 mmHg confirmed within a short interval (minutes) to facilitate timely antihypertensive therapy
	- *And:*
		-   Proteinuria 
			- ≥300 mg per 24-hour urine collection {or this amount extrapolated from a timed collection}, or 
			- protein:creatinine ratio ≥0.3, or 
			- urine dipstick reading ≥2+ {if other quantitative methods are not available}
				- Although the visual dipstick test has a poor predictive value, it still remains an important screening test due to easy availability, convenience and low cost. 
				- Approximate equivalence is 
					- Trace=0.15 to 0.3 g/l, 
					- 1+ is 0.3 g/l, 
					- 2+ is 1g/l, 
					- 3+ is 3g/l.
    - *Or, in the absence of proteinuria, new-onset hypertension with the new onset of any of the following:*
		-   Thrombocytopenia (platelet count <100,000/microL)
		-   Renal insufficiency (serum creatinine of >1.1 mg/dL  or a doubling of the serum creatinine concentration in the absence of other renal disease)
		-   Impaired liver function as indicated by liver transaminase levels at least twice the normal concentration
		-   Pulmonary edema
		-   Persistent cerebral or visual symptoms
- **Preeclampsia with severe features**
	- Previously called as severe preeclampsia
	- *Any of these findings in a patient with preeclampsia:*
		-   Systolic blood pressure ≥160 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure ≥110 mmHg on 2 occasions at least 4 hours apart (unless antihypertensive therapy is initiated before this time)
		-   Thrombocytopenia (platelet count <100,000/microL)
		-   Impaired liver function as indicated by liver transaminase levels at least twice the normal concentration or severe persistent right upper quadrant or epigastric pain unresponsive to medication and not accounted for by alternative diagnoses, or both
		-   Progressive renal insufficiency (serum creatinine concentration >1.1 mg/dL or a doubling of the serum creatinine concentration in the absence of other renal disease)
		-   Pulmonary edema
		-   Persistent cerebral or visual disturbances
- **Eclampsia**
	-   In a patient with preeclampsia, generalized seizures that cannot be attributed to other causes
- **HELLP syndrome**
	-   Presence of Hemolysis, Elevated Liver enzymes, and Low Platelet count; hypertension may be present (HELLP in such cases is often considered a variant of preeclampsia)
- **Chronic (preexisting) hypertension**
	-   Hypertension diagnosed or present before pregnancy or before 20 weeks of gestation. ==Hypertension that is first diagnosed during pregnancy and persists for at least 12 weeks post-delivery== is also considered chronic hypertension.
	    -   The blood pressure criteria are systolic blood pressure ≥140 mmHg, diastolic blood pressure ≥90 mmHg, or both. Ideally, this diagnosis is based on at least 2 elevated blood pressure measurements taken at least 4 hours apart. In the setting of severe hypertension, the diagnosis can be confirmed in a shorter interval to facilitate timely treatment.
- **Chronic hypertension with superimposed preeclampsia**
	- *Any of these findings in a patient with chronic hypertension:*
		-   A sudden increase in blood pressure that was previously well-controlled or an escalation of antihypertensive therapy to control blood pressure
		-   New onset of proteinuria or sudden increase in proteinuria in a patient with known proteinuria before or early in pregnancy
- **Chronic hypertension with superimposed preeclampsia with severe features**
	- *Any of these findings in a patient with chronic hypertension and superimposed preeclampsia:*
		-   Systolic blood pressure ≥160 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure ≥110 mmHg despite escalation of antihypertensive therapy
		-   Thrombocytopenia (platelet count <100,000/microL)
		-   Impaired liver function as indicated by liver transaminase levels at least twice the normal concentration or severe persistent right upper quadrant or epigastric pain unresponsive to medication and not accounted for by alternative diagnoses, or both
		-   New-onset or worsening renal insufficiency
		-   Pulmonary edema
		-   Persistent cerebral or visual disturbances
### Gestational Hypertension 
- What happened to the term **PIH**
	- Gestational hypertension was earlier referred to as “pregnancy-induced hypertension,” or “PIH” and considered to be a relatively benign condition. 
	- The old name was a source of confusion because it was also used to denote all forms of hypertension during pregnancy. 
	- Also, the condition (PIH) is not benign and pregnancy outcomes in severe gestational hypertension are worse than in mild preeclampsia
- Maternal & perinatal outcome 
	- Women with mild gestational hypertension have an increased incidence of obstetrical interventions such as induction of labour and caesarean section. 
	- Women with severe gestational hypertension have a higher incidence of preterm birth and small for gestational age (SGA) newborns than in those with normal pregnancy or with mild preeclampsia
	- most frequent complication of gestational hypertension is its progress to preeclampsia
		- The likelihood of progression to preeclampsia depends on *severity* of hypertension and the gestational age at the *time* of diagnosis. 
		- The earlier the gestation at presentation and more severe the hypertension, the higher the risk of developing preeclampsia and associated morbidity
			- Early gestational hypertension shares with preeclampsia a high incidence of poor placentation with histologic evidence of placental ischaemia and haemodynamic changes characterized by vasoconstriction and decreased cardiac output.
- *High-Risk Women* with Gestational Hypertension 
	- High risk factors 
		- Severe hypertension ≥160/110
		- Gestational age less than 30 weeks
		- Evidence of end-organs damage (elevated serum creatinine, liver enzymes, LDH, decreased platelet count)
		- Oligohydramnios
		- Fetal growth restriction
		- Abnormal uterine and/or umbilical Doppler velocimetry
	- they need admission -> for further evaluation & start medical management 
		- The objectives of care are the pharmacologic control of their blood pressure and the early detection of preeclampsia, end-organ damage, and fetal decompensation. 
- Maternal & Fetal surveillance #Bedside/OPD in with Low risk women
	- From the maternal side, the review includes assessment of the levels of blood pressure at home, the presence or absence of symptoms suggestive of end-organ damage (blurred vision, epigastric pain), and the presence of proteinuria. 
	- From the fetal side, the review includes daily charting of fetal movements and measurement of the uterine fundal height. 
		- Performance of nonstress test (NST) is probably unnecessary if the fetal growth and uterine, umbilical and cerebral fetal Dopplers are normal at initial assessment
	- When the proteinuria is trace or 1+, it is necessary to send the random sample to the lab for determination of the protein/creatinine and calcium/creatinine ratio. 
		- A protein/creatinine ratio > 0.30 is indicative of preeclampsia and a value less than 0.20 rules out significant proteinuria.
		- Patients with preeclampsia have hypocalcuiria and the finding of a calcium/creatinine ratio <0.06 strongly suggests that this condition is present.
- For women with mild gestational hypertension, induction of labour after 38–39 weeks and vaginal delivery is appropriate. #Reference/textbook/Arias 


### Preeclampsia

### Chronic HTN & Pregnancy
- **Pathophysiology**
	- Normal pregnancy is characterized by increased plasma volume (preload), increased cardiac output, and decreased peripheral vascular resistance (PVR). These changes result in a physiologic decrease in mean blood pressure during the second trimester. 
	- Chronic hypertension will modify the normal haemodynamic characteristics of pregnancy in different ways depending on the severity and duration of the hypertension.
	- For reason unknown at present, *essential hypertension* starts with increased cardiac output and normal PVR. --> This phase is followed by a gradual increase in PVR and fall in cardiac output. --> The elevated blood pressure accelerates the progression of arteriosclerosis and through this mechanism produces damage to the heart, brain, kidneys and other target organs. 
		- This process takes 30 or more years from beginning to end with the exception of a few patients who develop accelerated hypertension. 
	- A large majority of pregnant women with chronic essential hypertension are in the early stages of this process and usually have elevated cardiac output and normal or mildly elevated PVR and rarely show evidence of end organ damage. 
		- However, a ==normal PVR(in normotensives pregnant PVR is ↓) in the presence of elevated cardiac output is abnormal because the physiologic response during pregnancy to the increase in cardiac output is a decrease in PVR.==
	- Pregnancy is associated with a significant increase in intravascular volume that causes an increase in cardiac output that starts at end of first trimester and peaks at about 28–30 weeks gestation. 
	- Women with chronic hypertension have a limited ability to counterbalance this increase in cardiac output by further decreasing their PVR and maintain their blood pressure under normal limit. Subsequently as a consequence of this limited ability, their blood pressure starts to rise. 
	- The aggravation of chronic hypertension during the third trimester of pregnancy differs from preeclampsia because of the absence of proteinuria or presence of other end-organ injury.
- For management and counseling purposes, chronic hypertension in pregnancy is categorized as low risk or high risk.
- The two most common complications are superimposed preeclampsia and placental abruption.
- Fetal morbidity and mortality is directly related to the severity of hypertension and presence of preeclampsia. Decreased placental perfusion leads to SGA fetus
- **Management**
	- #Reference/textbook/Arias 
		- ![[Pasted image 20220703233444.png]]
	- Ideally, women with chronic hypertension should be evaluated pre-conceptionally in order to determine aetiology and severity of hypertension, identify possible presence of end organ disease, coexistence of other medical disease and counsel the patient accordingly. 
		- Unfortunately, the majority of these patients are seen after conception.
	- The history and physical examination should be directed to determine the duration of disease, the antihypertensive medications used, the presence of signs or symptoms suggestive of secondary hypertension or end organ damage.
		- Renal impairment is one of the earliest manifestations of end organ damage and presence of proteinuria is important for diagnosing superimposed preeclampsia and its associated morbidity.
	- *Investigations for Chronic Hypertensives Presenting Prior to 20 Weeks of Gestation*
		- **All patients**
			- Establish baseline blood pressure values
			- Complete blood count with platelets
			- Establish baseline renal function tests (serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, serum uric acid, serum electrolytes)
				- However, practically creatinine clearance may be ordered only if the serum creatinine concentration is above 0.8 mg/dL, the upper limit of normal for pregnancy
			- Complete urinalysis for microscopy for albumin, sugar, WBCs, RBCs and casts
			- Urine culture and sensitivity
			- Spot urine for protein/creatinine ratio for screening or
			- 24-hour urine protein
			- ECG and echocardiography
			- Ophthalmic examination (Fundus)
			- Glucose tolerance test
		- **Selected patients** -> To rule out secondary/reversible cause of hypertension
			- Renal ultrasound, renal Doppler flows (if feasible as in early pregnancy)
			- Fasting free plasma metanephrine or 24-hour urine metanephrine
			- Serum potassium levels or plasma renin activity
			- ANA (antinuclear antibody) titers
	- Prepregnancy Counseling #Bedside/counseling/prepregnancy 
		- weight loss for obese women, 
		- avoiding alcohol and smoking
		- Low salt diet
		- medications reviewed and changes made in the antihypertensive drugs that are unsafe in pregnancy
			- Diuretics should be avoided as they reduce the blood flow to the placenta. 
			- Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors are known as teratogens, classified by FDA as Class D
		- High risk women with other comorbidities are counseled in depth regarding the associated maternal & perinatal outcome
			- Women with significant renal impairment (serum creatinine . 1.4 mg%), diabetes with vascular involvement (Class R/F), cardiomyopathy, collagen vascular disease, coarctation of aorta should be counseled in depth about the increased risk of maternal and perinatal complication.
			- They should be made aware that pregnancy can exacerbate their condition with potential for causing renal failure, cardiac failure or even death. 
			- Such patients if still plan to conceive should be managed in a tertiary care center under a maternal fetal medicine specialist and in conjunction with a medical specialist.
	- **General Care during Pregnancy**
		- They should have prenatal clinic visits very 2 weeks until 32 or 34 weeks and then every week until the end of pregnancy.

# Bedside 
### Measuring BP
- Diastolic blood pressure is determined as a disappearance of sound (Korotkoff phase V). 
	- Korotkoff phase V (disappearance) as opposed to Korotkoff phase IV (muffling) was chosen as it is more reproducible and showed better correlation with true diastolic blood pressure in pregnancy. 
	- Where KV is absent, KIV should be accepted.
- For accuracy, mercury sphygmomanometer is preferred. 
	- Automated systems for blood pressure measurements have been shown to be unreliable in severe preeclampsia and tend to _under-record_ the true value particularly the systolic blood pressure
- The blood pressure level should be taken with an appropriate size cuff with the patients in an upright position with their right arm supported in horizontal position at the level of the heart, after a 10 minute or longer rest period.
	- length 1.5 times the upper arm circumference *or* a cuff with a bladder that encircles 80% or more of the arm 
	- For patients in the hospital, the blood pressure can be taken when the patient is sitting or left lateral recumbent position with the arm at the level of the heart. The cuff should encircle and cover two-thirds of the length of the arm. 
	- A large cuff should be used for obese patients. 
	- When the patients lie on their left side and the blood pressure is taken on their right arm, the blood pressure is falsely low by as much as 15 mmHg.

- 1.9 Antihypertensive treatment during the postnatal period, including during breastfeeding
	- 1.9.1 Advise women with hypertension who wish to breastfeed that their treatment can be adapted to accommodate breastfeeding, and that the need to take antihypertensive medication does not prevent them from breastfeeding.
	- 1.9.2 Explain to women with hypertension who wish to breastfeed that:
	    - antihypertensive medicines can pass into breast milk
	    - most antihypertensive medicines taken while breastfeeding only lead to very low levels in breast milk, so the amounts taken in by babies are very small and would be unlikely to have any clinical effect
	    - most medicines are not tested in pregnant or breastfeeding women, so disclaimers in the manufacturer's information are not because of any specific safety concerns or evidence of harm. Make decisions on treatment together with the woman, based on her preferences.
	- 1.9.3 As antihypertensive agents have the potential to transfer into breast milk:
	    - consider monitoring the blood pressure of babies, especially those born preterm, who have symptoms of low blood pressure for the first few weeks
	    - when discharged home, advise women to monitor their babies for drowsiness, lethargy, pallor, cold peripheries or poor feeding. 
	- 1.9.4 *Offer enalapril* to treat hypertension in women during the postnatal period, with appropriate monitoring of maternal renal function and maternal serum potassium. 
	- 1.9.5 For women of black African or Caribbean family origin with hypertension during the postnatal period, consider antihypertensive treatment with:
	    - nifedipine or
	    - **amlodipine** if the woman has previously used this to successfully control her blood pressure. 
	- 1.9.6 For women with hypertension in the postnatal period, if blood pressure is not controlled with a single medicine, consider a combination of nifedipine (or amlodipine) and enalapril. If this combination is not tolerated or is ineffective, consider either:
	    - adding **atenolol or labetalol** to the combination treatment or
	    - swapping 1 of the medicines already being used for atenolol or labetalol.
	- 1.9.7 When treating women with antihypertensive medication during the postnatal period, use medicines that are taken once daily when possible. 
	- 1.9.8 Where possible, *avoid using diuretics or angiotensin receptor blockers* to treat hypertension in women in the postnatal period who are breastfeeding or expressing milk. 
	- 1.9.9 Treat women with hypertension in the postnatal period who are not breastfeeding and who are not planning to breastfeed in line with the NICE guideline on hypertension in adults.

		- 1.10.2 Advise women who have had a hypertensive disorder of pregnancy that this is associated with an increased risk of hypertension and cardiovascular disease in later life 
		    - ![[Pasted image 20220706051411.png]]
		- 1.10.3 Advise women who have had a hypertensive disorder of pregnancy to discuss how to reduce their risk of cardiovascular disease, including hypertensive disorders, with their GP or specialist. This may include:
		    - avoiding smoking, as recommended in the NICE guideline on stop smoking interventions and services
		    - maintaining a healthy lifestyle, as recommended in the NICE guideline on cardiovascular disease
		    - maintaining a healthy weight, as recommended in the NICE guideline on obesity. 
		- 1.10.4 In women who have had pre-eclampsia or hypertension with early birth before 34 weeks, consider pre-pregnancy counselling to discuss possible risks of recurrent hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, and how to lower them for any future pregnancies. 
	- Body mass index and recurrence of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy
		- 1.10.5 Advise women who have had pre-eclampsia to achieve and keep a BMI within the healthy range before their next pregnancy (18.5-24.9 kg/m2). See also the NICE guideline on obesity: identification, assessment and management.
	- Inter-pregnancy interval and recurrence of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy
		- 1.10.6 Advise women who have had pre-eclampsia that the likelihood of recurrence increases with an inter-pregnancy interval greater than 10 years.
	- Long-term risk of end-stage kidney disease
		- 1.10.7 Tell women with a history of pre-eclampsia who have no proteinuria and no hypertension at the postnatal review (6-8 weeks after the birth) that although the relative risk of end-stage kidney disease is increased, the absolute risk is low and no further follow-up is necessary.
	- Thrombophilia and the risk of pre-eclampsia
